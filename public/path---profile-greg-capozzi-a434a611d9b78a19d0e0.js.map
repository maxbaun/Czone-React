We had originally talked to a very large wedding company that many people use, more specifically the owner of that company. At the end of the convo, I didn‚Äôt feel any ‚Äúconnection‚Äù but figured this guy was supposed to be the best so let‚Äôs do it. During our conversation he referenced his business numerous times and was pretty cocky but I ignored it. Thankfully, before we signed, we ended up getting in touch with Greg from C-Zone who many people referred us to as well. It was a COMPLETE 180 in the conversation. Greg was truly a breath of fresh air, talked about OUR wedding, OUR guests, OUR day. We could feel his passion immediately and not knowing much about music, he explained his process and feeling the crowd instead of going in with a ‚Äúset playlist‚Äù as most DJs do. Again, we didn‚Äôt understand much about the technical aspect he was discussing but his excitement was getting us excited, a match made in heaven. We immediately signed with him and throughout the rest of our planning process, we never second guessed that decision.<br />\\nFast forward to 6 months before the wedding, Greg remembered our awesome conversation and that excitement came right back. At that point we had booked the jazz trio with him (another amazing decision) and confirmed the uplighting and monogram that he custom made for us with the guys he worked with.<br />\\nFast forward to our final meeting, we got to meet him and his lovely wife Diane (couple goals). For the first HOUR we just chatted about the wedding and life and music and it was like we had known him for years. Finally, we got to the nitty gritty details and he was so great. We laughed about the songs we didn‚Äôt want him to play, he wrote down in his notes how to pronounce every name in our wedding party correctly and we just got so hyped up for the night. Greg has also worked with a lot of venues over the years so those great connections he has with the coordinators are so key.</p>\\n<p>Now for the wedding night! The monogram was set up exactly where we wanted it, the jazz trio set the mood during the cocktail hour and Greg came down to make sure everyone was in order for introductions and to see how we were doing&#8230; oh, and also hyped up our wedding party! He absolutely killed it all night long. Mixed songs, read the crowd, and saw how packed the dance floor was at all times and chose to keep the party going without any slow songs which of course the crowd went nuts over. Throughout the night people came up to us telling us how great he was, people that I know don‚Äôt normally dance at weddings were up on their feet, it was wild to see. My husband and I were so sad to have to say goodbye to him but thankfully the following day, several engaged couples at our wedding asked us for his info so we hope to see him in the future!</p>\\n<p>In summary, I chose Greg because the guy just has straight up crazy talent, reading his audience, incredible mixes, and the passion is just felt all the way through the process. Greg is such a down to earth guy, he is not like an obnoxious club DJ that talks about himself and his business the whole time, it was so refreshing. Actually, he didn&#8217;t get on the mic once except to make introductions and announcements because he didn‚Äôt need to, his music hyped the crowd up, he didn‚Äôt need to scream and play pump horns and crap. I can not recommend him enough, I so hope we see him at an event in the future.</p>\\n<p></p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Lindsay &amp; Marc, Cruiseport, 7.13.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nI work in the hotel industry and see A LOT of weddings in the course of a year. This also means that I see a wide variety of DJ&#8217;s, live music, bands, etc. When it came to planning our own wedding I knew I wanted a quality company that would listen to us, guide us, and most importantly be something my guests wouldn&#8217;t forget. We got all that and then some with Greg at C-Zone. Upon our inquiry, he immediately set up a google hangout call with us and made sure we connected on every level. He was informative, hilarious, and a great person to talk to. To me, that is an extremely important part of the wedding planning process, as I wanted to enjoy communicating with my wedding vendors. He and Diane were responsive, flexible, and accommodating to any questions we had. He was always there to guide us through song choices and tricky things like parent dances. We also booked him for live sax music, a keys player, and uplighting. To which all of these things were our choice. At no point did he try to pressure us into including extras or make our event about anything other than US! We knew we were in good hands with an experienced professional. Throughout the process and on the wedding day, we could not have been more amazed and pleased with EVERYTHING C-Zone provided. Everyone RAVED about the live music during the ceremony and cocktail hour, all of the up lights were in the perfect spot, and the dance floor was rocking all night. The C-Zone quote is &#8220;It&#8217;s not our show, it&#8217;s your event&#8221;, and this is really true. Not once did Greg promote his services over the mic- he solely concentrated on making our music set and dance floor the best it could be, while still being a great MC for intros and necessary announcements. The transitions were perfect and our crowd loved chatting him up when they had requests. By the next day, the C-Zone name was something everyone was passing along. We are so grateful to Greg and his entire team for everything they did for us and for being part of the most amazing day. So moral of the story is- if you&#8217;re looking for a quality, talented, and committed music vendor- you will not find a company better than C-Zone- so just stop looking!!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Noelle & Daniel, The Barn at Gibbet Hill, 11.1.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nWe are so thrilled we had C-Zone entertainment for our wedding and I would 1000% recommend them to any other couples! For our package, we had a string trio for the ceremony, microphones &#038; wireless lapel mics for the ceremony, musicians during cocktail hour, DJ services for the rest of the reception, and uplighting. It was a large package, but Greg and his team executed it all flawlessly!! Our guests raved about our DJ and people were dancing ALL night, which is probably the best indicator of a great DJ! Greg was extremely professional with the announcements during the evening (no cheesy comments!!) and he was on the ball with our timeline to ensure the evening flowed smoothly. During the planning process, we had a couple of phone calls with Greg at different stages and he was always so friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and full of recommendations. We felt like he was truly invested in making sure we had the best party for our wedding, which made us feel extremely confident in him on the wedding day. We could tell that he is a very passionate musician and we had no worries that he‚Äôd be able to create the vibe we wanted. Beyond the music, setting up the appropriate number of sound systems and microphones (especially for the ceremony) is so critical and Greg was all over those details for us. We had no issues at all with people not being able to hear, even though the ceremony was outside. The process of preparing for the wedding with Czone was also extremely organized and well-managed between Greg and Diane. I loved that C-Zone uses an online planning portal, which helps make it very straightforward to list out all timeline details and song requests. Greg and Diane were both highly responsive to any questions we had, which is not always the case with wedding vendors!! You will have no regrets if you choose C-Zone for your wedding!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Erica & Nick, Turner Hill, 9.14.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nMy husband and I could not be happier with our decision to book Greg for our wedding. From our initial informational phone call through our final planning meeting, Greg was professional, kind and personable. In addition, he is TRULY an artist who is familiar with many types of music and really knows how to read a room. Our guests stayed on the dance floor all night long and I say this without exaggeration, I lost count of how many people told me we had the best DJ ever. Greg certainly played an integral part in making our wedding the most fun we&#8217;ve ever had. I&#8217;d whole heartedly recommend Greg&#8217;s services for any event.<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Laura & Zandy, Hawthorne Hotel, 8.23.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>So organized &#038; truly knows what they are doing!</h3>\\n<p>Greg &#038; his team at C-Zone Entertainment are the obvious choice to make your wedding day truly unforgettable! My sister and I both used them for our wedding &#038; every single guest could not stop talking about how wonderful the music was &#038; you could tell because every person was dancing all night long! This is what couple&#8217;s dream for on their wedding day! You want the music to be enjoyable for every type of person at your wedding &#038; Greg just truly understands how to read the crowd. Our wedding day would NOT have been the same without Greg. Book them now &#038; book the live trio for cocktail hour, too! You won&#8217;t regret it and all of your guests will be blown away!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Callie & Mike, Bedford Village Inn, 10.4.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Absolutely perfect, 100%</h3>\\n<p>My wedding was amazing because of these guys!!</p>\\n<p>First of all, DJ Greg and C-Zone made the planning process so easy and stress-free!! The online planning tool contains everything you need to help you plan the details. The online meetings with Greg were super convenient and so helpful in the planning process, as he took the time and care to ensure that we were getting exactly what we wanted.<br />\\nC-Zone truly has so many different options available for all your music needs on your wedding day. They supplied the music during our prelude, had a live jazz band for cocktail hour, and then Greg was our DJ for the reception.</p>\\n<p>While planning with Greg, he assured me that he would be able to read the crowd and, based on that, play songs that would keep people on the dance floor! He did exactly that!</p>\\n<p>He knew just what songs to play (including all my requests), and we danced the entire night!! People are still raving a month later about how much fun they had at the wedding, and I know that wouldn&#8217;t have been the case if it wasn&#8217;t for Greg!!<br />\\n100% would recommend!!!!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Jenna & Peter, Castle Manor Inn, 9.28.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Professional, talented and made the reception the huge dance party we envisioned!</h3>\\n<p>We had very high expectations for a DJ and C-Zone definitely exceeded them! C-Zone, Greg and Diane were very professional and easy to work with, their online tools were great and they were super communicative throughout the whole process. Most importantly they made our wedding the awesome dance party we were hoping for. It was clear from our first conversation on the phone that Greg was really passionate about his work and that made him stand out from other options, so the decision to move forward was easy. We knew the broad strokes of how we envisioned our reception and Greg helped turn that into a reality. He took a sampling of music that we told him we liked and turned that into a set that our guests from ages 19 to 90 enjoyed and danced too. One of my guests commented that our dance floor should&#8217;ve been even bigger because it was packed all night long. Beyond the reception Greg was the MC for the entire wedding. This is something we hadn&#8217;t realized we needed when first looking for a DJ, but were very happy to have. He managed the music at the ceremony and cocktail hour, all the announcements, speech introductions etc. I have only great things to say about them and would highly recommend C-Zone for your wedding!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Seth & Erica, The Collonade Boston, 5.11.19</p></div>\\n\"},\"image\":{\"localFile\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.302734375,\"src\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-2c2fe.jpeg 110w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-a2e2b.jpeg 220w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg 440w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-77eb3.jpeg 660w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-78eca.jpeg 880w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-6ece6.jpeg 1320w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg 2001w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\",\"originalImg\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg\"},\"full\":{\"src\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg\",\"height\":307,\"width\":400,\"srcSet\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg 1x,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-738fa.jpeg 1.5x,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-4042a.jpeg 2x,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-935ac.jpeg 3x\"}}}},\"yoast\":{\"title\":\"\",\"canonical\":\"\",\"metaDescription\":\"\",\"linkdex\":\"\",\"metakeywords\":\"\",\"noIndex\":\"\",\"noFollow\":\"\",\"meta_robots_adv\":\"\",\"metaKeywords\":\"\",\"redirect\":\"\",\"ogTitle\":\"\",\"ogDescription\":\"\",\"ogImage\":\"\",\"twitterTitle\":\"\",\"twitterDescription\":\"\",\"twitterImage\":\"\"}},\"site\":{\"id\":\"Site\",\"siteMeta\":{\"title\":\"C-Zone Entertainment\",\"subtitle\":\"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"8bf0629c-1ea8-5945-b721-7260a9ed3018\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---profile-greg-capozzi-a434a611d9b78a19d0e0.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"profile\":{\"id\":\"8bf0629c-1ea8-5945-b721-7260a9ed3018\",\"content\":\"<p><div class=\\\"content-block  text-center\\\"><p>Greg Capozzi is the owner and founder of C-Zone Entertainment.

At that point we had booked the jazz trio with him (another amazing decision) and confirmed the uplighting and monogram that he custom made for us with the guys he worked with.<br />\\nFast forward to our final meeting, we got to meet him and his lovely wife Diane (couple goals). For the first HOUR we just chatted about the wedding and life and music and it was like we had known him for years. Finally, we got to the nitty gritty details and he was so great. We laughed about the songs we didn‚Äôt want him to play, he wrote down in his notes how to pronounce every name in our wedding party correctly and we just got so hyped up for the night. Greg has also worked with a lot of venues over the years so those great connections he has with the coordinators are so key.</p>\\n<p>Now for the wedding night! The monogram was set up exactly where we wanted it, the jazz trio set the mood during the cocktail hour and Greg came down to make sure everyone was in order for introductions and to see how we were doing&#8230; oh, and also hyped up our wedding party! He absolutely killed it all night long. Mixed songs, read the crowd, and saw how packed the dance floor was at all times and chose to keep the party going without any slow songs which of course the crowd went nuts over. Throughout the night people came up to us telling us how great he was, people that I know don‚Äôt normally dance at weddings were up on their feet, it was wild to see. My husband and I were so sad to have to say goodbye to him but thankfully the following day, several engaged couples at our wedding asked us for his info so we hope to see him in the future!</p>\\n<p>In summary, I chose Greg because the guy just has straight up crazy talent, reading his audience, incredible mixes, and the passion is just felt all the way through the process. Greg is such a down to earth guy, he is not like an obnoxious club DJ that talks about himself and his business the whole time, it was so refreshing. Actually, he didn&#8217;t get on the mic once except to make introductions and announcements because he didn‚Äôt need to, his music hyped the crowd up, he didn‚Äôt need to scream and play pump horns and crap. I can not recommend him enough, I so hope we see him at an event in the future.</p>\\n<p></p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Lindsay &amp; Marc, Cruiseport, 7.13.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nI work in the hotel industry and see A LOT of weddings in the course of a year. This also means that I see a wide variety of DJ&#8217;s, live music, bands, etc. When it came to planning our own wedding I knew I wanted a quality company that would listen to us, guide us, and most importantly be something my guests wouldn&#8217;t forget. We got all that and then some with Greg at C-Zone. Upon our inquiry, he immediately set up a google hangout call with us and made sure we connected on every level. He was informative, hilarious, and a great person to talk to. To me, that is an extremely important part of the wedding planning process, as I wanted to enjoy communicating with my wedding vendors. He and Diane were responsive, flexible, and accommodating to any questions we had. He was always there to guide us through song choices and tricky things like parent dances. We also booked him for live sax music, a keys player, and uplighting. To which all of these things were our choice. At no point did he try to pressure us into including extras or make our event about anything other than US! We knew we were in good hands with an experienced professional. Throughout the process and on the wedding day, we could not have been more amazed and pleased with EVERYTHING C-Zone provided. Everyone RAVED about the live music during the ceremony and cocktail hour, all of the up lights were in the perfect spot, and the dance floor was rocking all night. The C-Zone quote is &#8220;It&#8217;s not our show, it&#8217;s your event&#8221;, and this is really true. Not once did Greg promote his services over the mic- he solely concentrated on making our music set and dance floor the best it could be, while still being a great MC for intros and necessary announcements. The transitions were perfect and our crowd loved chatting him up when they had requests. By the next day, the C-Zone name was something everyone was passing along. We are so grateful to Greg and his entire team for everything they did for us and for being part of the most amazing day. So moral of the story is- if you&#8217;re looking for a quality, talented, and committed music vendor- you will not find a company better than C-Zone- so just stop looking!!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Noelle & Daniel, The Barn at Gibbet Hill, 11.1.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nWe are so thrilled we had C-Zone entertainment for our wedding and I would 1000% recommend them to any other couples! For our package, we had a string trio for the ceremony, microphones &#038; wireless lapel mics for the ceremony, musicians during cocktail hour, DJ services for the rest of the reception, and uplighting. It was a large package, but Greg and his team executed it all flawlessly!! Our guests raved about our DJ and people were dancing ALL night, which is probably the best indicator of a great DJ! Greg was extremely professional with the announcements during the evening (no cheesy comments!!) and he was on the ball with our timeline to ensure the evening flowed smoothly. During the planning process, we had a couple of phone calls with Greg at different stages and he was always so friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and full of recommendations. We felt like he was truly invested in making sure we had the best party for our wedding, which made us feel extremely confident in him on the wedding day. We could tell that he is a very passionate musician and we had no worries that he‚Äôd be able to create the vibe we wanted. Beyond the music, setting up the appropriate number of sound systems and microphones (especially for the ceremony) is so critical and Greg was all over those details for us. We had no issues at all with people not being able to hear, even though the ceremony was outside. The process of preparing for the wedding with Czone was also extremely organized and well-managed between Greg and Diane. I loved that C-Zone uses an online planning portal, which helps make it very straightforward to list out all timeline details and song requests. Greg and Diane were both highly responsive to any questions we had, which is not always the case with wedding vendors!! You will have no regrets if you choose C-Zone for your wedding!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Erica & Nick, Turner Hill, 9.14.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nMy husband and I could not be happier with our decision to book Greg for our wedding. From our initial informational phone call through our final planning meeting, Greg was professional, kind and personable. In addition, he is TRULY an artist who is familiar with many types of music and really knows how to read a room. Our guests stayed on the dance floor all night long and I say this without exaggeration, I lost count of how many people told me we had the best DJ ever. Greg certainly played an integral part in making our wedding the most fun we&#8217;ve ever had. I&#8217;d whole heartedly recommend Greg&#8217;s services for any event.<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Laura & Zandy, Hawthorne Hotel, 8.23.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>So organized &#038; truly knows what they are doing!</h3>\\n<p>Greg &#038; his team at C-Zone Entertainment are the obvious choice to make your wedding day truly unforgettable! My sister and I both used them for our wedding &#038; every single guest could not stop talking about how wonderful the music was &#038; you could tell because every person was dancing all night long! This is what couple&#8217;s dream for on their wedding day! You want the music to be enjoyable for every type of person at your wedding &#038; Greg just truly understands how to read the crowd. Our wedding day would NOT have been the same without Greg. Book them now &#038; book the live trio for cocktail hour, too! You won&#8217;t regret it and all of your guests will be blown away!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Callie & Mike, Bedford Village Inn, 10.4.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Absolutely perfect, 100%</h3>\\n<p>My wedding was amazing because of these guys!!</p>\\n<p>First of all, DJ Greg and C-Zone made the planning process so easy and stress-free!! The online planning tool contains everything you need to help you plan the details. The online meetings with Greg were super convenient and so helpful in the planning process, as he took the time and care to ensure that we were getting exactly what we wanted.<br />\\nC-Zone truly has so many different options available for all your music needs on your wedding day. They supplied the music during our prelude, had a live jazz band for cocktail hour, and then Greg was our DJ for the reception.</p>\\n<p>While planning with Greg, he assured me that he would be able to read the crowd and, based on that, play songs that would keep people on the dance floor! He did exactly that!</p>\\n<p>He knew just what songs to play (including all my requests), and we danced the entire night!! People are still raving a month later about how much fun they had at the wedding, and I know that wouldn&#8217;t have been the case if it wasn&#8217;t for Greg!!<br />\\n100% would recommend!!!!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Jenna & Peter, Castle Manor Inn, 9.28.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Professional, talented and made the reception the huge dance party we envisioned!</h3>\\n<p>We had very high expectations for a DJ and C-Zone definitely exceeded them! C-Zone, Greg and Diane were very professional and easy to work with, their online tools were great and they were super communicative throughout the whole process. Most importantly they made our wedding the awesome dance party we were hoping for. It was clear from our first conversation on the phone that Greg was really passionate about his work and that made him stand out from other options, so the decision to move forward was easy. We knew the broad strokes of how we envisioned our reception and Greg helped turn that into a reality. He took a sampling of music that we told him we liked and turned that into a set that our guests from ages 19 to 90 enjoyed and danced too. One of my guests commented that our dance floor should&#8217;ve been even bigger because it was packed all night long. Beyond the reception Greg was the MC for the entire wedding. This is something we hadn&#8217;t realized we needed when first looking for a DJ, but were very happy to have. He managed the music at the ceremony and cocktail hour, all the announcements, speech introductions etc. I have only great things to say about them and would highly recommend C-Zone for your wedding!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Seth & Erica, The Collonade Boston, 5.11.19</p></div>\\n\"},\"image\":{\"localFile\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.302734375,\"src\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-2c2fe.jpeg 110w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-a2e2b.jpeg 220w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg 440w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-77eb3.jpeg 660w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-78eca.jpeg 880w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-6ece6.jpeg 1320w,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg 2001w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\",\"originalImg\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg\"},\"full\":{\"src\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg\",\"height\":307,\"width\":400,\"srcSet\":\"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg 1x,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-738fa.jpeg 1.5x,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-4042a.jpeg 2x,\\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-935ac.jpeg 3x\"}}}},\"yoast\":{\"title\":\"\",\"canonical\":\"\",\"metaDescription\":\"\",\"linkdex\":\"\",\"metakeywords\":\"\",\"noIndex\":\"\",\"noFollow\":\"\",\"meta_robots_adv\":\"\",\"metaKeywords\":\"\",\"redirect\":\"\",\"ogTitle\":\"\",\"ogDescription\":\"\",\"ogImage\":\"\",\"twitterTitle\":\"\",\"twitterDescription\":\"\",\"twitterImage\":\"\"}},\"site\":{\"id\":\"Site\",\"siteMeta\":{\"title\":\"C-Zone Entertainment\",\"subtitle\":\"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"8bf0629c-1ea8-5945-b721-7260a9ed3018\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/profile-greg-capozzi.json\n// module id = 651\n// module chunks = 57769133523182"],"sourceRoot":""}
