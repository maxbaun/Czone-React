In pursuing his passion for great music he left the security of a day job and put all of his savings and resources into purchasing a state-of-the-art digital sound system, taught himself how to DJ, and started knocking on doors. Being a musician for his entire professional career that began in the early 1990&#8217;s, the transition was seamless. Soon the public recognized C-Zone&#8217;s talent and what started as a one man show has flourished into a full production company offering 12 DJs, multiple jazz and classical ensembles and some amazing lighting options. He is incredibly proud to have built this company from the ground up with nothing but hard work, dedication, persistence, passion and of course talent.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>As a DJ/Emcee, C-Zone has performed at countless special events including weddings, corporate functions, private parties, and much more. He currently performs at over 125 parties annually, mostly weddings and high-end corporate affairs. He has held residencies in some of Boston&#8217;s hottest venues including Felt, Umbria, Mantra and Pravda (now Gipsy Bar). And let&#8217;s not forget a few private parties for Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn during the filming of Mystic River. C-Zone&#8217;s personality, professionalism, and ability to keep the dance floor moving make him the ideal choice for your event.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p><br />\nAs a saxophone and woodwind player, C-Zone has performed all over the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean with appearances at The Montreal Jazz Festival, Disney World, Epcot Center, Club Med, Carnival Cruise Lines, and a guest appearance with performers from Cirque de Soleil.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Some highlights of C-Zone&#8217;s career include a 5 year tenure with Rippopotamus, voted &#8220;Best Funk Band&#8221; at the Boston Music Awards in 1996. This 8 piece all original funk/rock band routinely packed clubs such as The Middle East, Mama Kin, and Ryles. In the fall of 1996, one of Rippo&#8217;s songs was selected as the theme for &#8220;Singled Out,&#8221; a popular dating show on MTV. In 1998 Rippo performed at the internationally famous Montreal Jazz Festival, and rang in the New Year in 2000 with a week long stint at Jimmy Buffet&#8217;s Margaritaville in Key West, FL.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>More recently C-Zone has been working as an underground recording artist with some local and national record producers of dance music. One of his saxophone solos has been featured on Plastic City Records which specializes in House music. The same track was featured on a compilation called Sunrise at ES Cavallet in Ibiza in 2009. This is an incredible accomplishment since Ibiza is the number one destination for dance music in the world.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>C-Zone is not your average DJ. As a musician he hears and thinks about music differently and his unique approach has profound results on the dance floor. He will rock your cocktail and/or dinner set on his sax and pack your dance floor with his beats&#8230;</p></div></p>\n',title:"Greg Capozzi",acf:{title:"DJ, Emcee, Sax",video:"",facebook:"https://www.facebook.com/greg.capozzi.7",instagram:"http://instagram.com/czonemusic",testimonials:'<p><div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWhen looking for our wedding DJ, C-Zone came highly recommended by numerous people. We made the call and had a meeting with Greg. Immediately we knew he was it. We connected with Greg right away over our passion for music and he instantly understood the vibe we wanted to bring to our wedding. From start to finish, he rocked our wedding. We danced ALL NIGHT until the very end. There are wedding DJs and then there is C-Zone, musically talented and musically gifted, who will elevate your wedding to a level no one can touch. THE best of the best!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Malia and Mike, 11.1.24, Olio</p></div><br />\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nIf you’re debating booking C-Zone, DO IT! My husband and I knew we wanted a DJ, but also knew that a live music element would be so fun. We began looking for a sax player to do a sax fusion set (where the sax accompanies the DJ during the dance set). We were having trouble finding one, and then miraculously stumbled upon C-Zone 3 days (yes, 3 days!!!) before our wedding. </p>\n<p>Gina from C-Zone responded so fast and worked with Greg to make this happen! It truly felt like the stars aligned. Greg immediately called both me and our DJ to ensure our night would go seamlessly, discuss our music tastes, etc. When it came to the day of, Greg showed up early and set up, coordinated with our DJ, and then he helped give us the best dance floor ever!! We’ve had countless people reaching out raving about the “amazing sax player.” A big thank you to Greg and everyone at C-Zone for helping us pull this off!!! You helped make our night unforgettable!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Caroline, 10.18.24, Danversport Yacht Club, </p></div><br />\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nC-Zone Entertainment made our wedding truly magical. We absolutely loved working with Greg and Gina, and they made every part of the planning process easy, stress free and fun! They were very professional and highly responsive to any questions or concerns we had. Greg was our DJ and he is not only a talented musician but also a genuinely cool guy &#8211; we loved having him at our wedding! We had many guests inquire about who our DJ was and tell us how much they enjoyed his work. We also had a string trio at our wedding (coordinated by C-Zone) who played beautiful classical music that helped set the scene and add a touch of elegance. Additionally, C-Zone provided uplighting for our wedding that truly elevated the look of the venue. I highly recommend their company and would absolutely use them again.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Kristina and Josh, 10.17.24, Peirce Farm at Witch Hill</p></div><br />\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nGreg and C-Zone went above and beyond at every point from planning to the end of the reception to make our wedding beautiful, fun and low-stress. Greg had a great energy over the consultation calls and immediately filled us with confidence that we would have a lively dance floor. We only had to give the word and Greg not only coordinated the hiring of a pianist for live music during the ceremony, but also offered to play saxophone as well (which he did beautifully). </p>\n<p>When it came time for dancing, sound was at a perfect level for the venue and the dance floor was expertly nurtured with song selections that kept all the guests engaged. Greg even had the presence of mind and initiative to capture some of the dance floor highlights on video. We were both so impressed by Greg’s professionalism, organization, relaxing demeanor, and sincere passion for the dance floor and consider ourselves incredibly lucky to have had him on our team.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Yushan and Will, 6.8.24, Hampshire House</p></div><br />\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe met Greg Capozzi of C-Zone Entertainment at a wedding expo at Granite Links in Braintree, MA &#8211; where my daughter held her wedding. My daughter handled so much of the wedding, and I only got involved with the music for the event. When it comes to a wedding reception, there are few more important aspects than the quality of the music. The DJ sets the tone much as the music sets the tone for a movie. While you may not be paying attention to the music while watching a movie, it is critical to the overall quality and excellence of an Oscar-winning film. Greg Capozzi is an artist supporting the joy of a wedding reception with carefully crafted music both during the meal and especially during the dancing parts of the reception. </p>\n<p>Greg and I had great conversations about music we loved at the expo, and I knew immediately he FELT music and we could trust him with our daughter&#8217;s wedding. Over the next few months, my daughter and Greg communicated over the music she wanted at the reception &#8211; and allowed me a bit of input. Together they came up with how the event would sound. It was a pleasure working with a professional who understood what was important to us and improved on our suggestions. The communication was fast and easy. The music for the ceremony was subtle but beautiful and added so much to the experience. </p>\n<p>People may not know that Greg plays saxophone but his playing &#8220;signed, sealed, delivered, I&#8217;m yours” as the party left the ceremony was stunning. When looking back on the reception through the videos and photos taken, it is clear how important the music was for the success of the evening &#8211; and it was a success. His music was the foundation upon which all the important parts of the evening were supported and it subtly added so much to the joy of the evening. </p>\n<p>When it was time to dance, we DANCED! In addition to my daughter and son-in-law’s requests, Greg selected excellent dance music from decades of choices, never missing a beat. He played music from strong women with a point of view (Aretha Franklin!), music with meaning (I Love You &#8211; The Climax Blues Band), and just plain fun music (Brick House &#8211; The Commodores). My daughter is a Swiftie and Greg made sure to honor her with music from her favorite artist. I know that Greg does so many weddings every year, but it seemed like our wedding was the only one he cared about &#8211; though I know that is just who he is. </p>\n<p>He understood what we wanted at our wedding &#8211; a celebration &#8211; and he delivered. He will give your wedding the same detailed attention. You only get one shot at a wedding: go with a pro who will add such quality to your event. I&#8217;m old enough to have been to many weddings, I have never seen a better wedding DJ than Greg Capozzi and C-Zone Entertainment. I highly recommend Greg and his team &#8211; you won&#8217;t be sorry!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Kaela and Kendal, 8.27.23, Granite Links</p></div></p>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBAX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB5sHoaqIa/8QAGRABAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDEiIj/9oACAEBAAEFAnTyvZG2Zq+phUmWqP8A/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oACAEDAQE/AYyP/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAES/9oACAECAQE/Aa0//8QAGhAAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERQQISMf/aAAgBAQAGPwKyTBRRwetCZ//EABsQAAMAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESExUUHw/9oACAEBAAE/IZqbRbqMDw8U+UVYt8NQoKtuQ2wUxWj/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEMjf/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARYf/aAAgBAwEBPxDC4x2v/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARUf/aAAgBAgEBPxDohhl//8QAHhABAQACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAMSFBUXFhkbH/2gAIAQEAAT8QjgNEp684CYvKXcJ94nGI62Xs1hJCBB5EmXGAR0W6+PeblEcwFeP3P//Z",aspectRatio:1.302734375,src:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg",srcSet:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-2c2fe.jpeg 110w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-a2e2b.jpeg 220w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg 440w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-77eb3.jpeg 660w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-78eca.jpeg 880w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-6ece6.jpeg 1320w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg 2001w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg"},full:{src:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg",height:307,width:400,srcSet:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg 1x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-738fa.jpeg 1.5x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-4042a.jpeg 2x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-935ac.jpeg 3x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"8bf0629c-1ea8-5945-b721-7260a9ed3018"}}}});
