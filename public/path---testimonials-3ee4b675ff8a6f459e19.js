Greg and his team were always on time, courteous, thorough, and enthusiastic about their work. It was evident from the start that Greg knew his craft and took pride in being the best he possibly could be every time he took a job.\r\n\r\nPreparation for the wedding â€“ I mentioned above that Greg and his team was thorough but I cannot stress this point enough. Although the form was tedious, Greg worked hand in hand with my wife and I to make sure every detail of the wedding was planned and prepared so that we had nothing to worry about on the day. One major point, Greg took the time to not just learn the name of every person he was going to have to announce throughout the night, we had a special meeting to go over the phonetics of each name so that nothing was left to chance. For all the weddings Iâ€™ve been too where the DJ or Band butchers someoneâ€™s name, this was exceptional and was a really nice touch.\r\n\r\nWedding Day â€“ Day of, all the preparation clearly paid off and Greg and his team really made the day perfect. He kept the flow of the day going and made sure that we stayed on schedule throughout the night, then when it was time to let loose he brought down the house with GREAT tunes!\r\n\r\nCouple things stand out for me about the day: 1) Professionalism â€“ I cannot say enough about how crisp and seamless everything seemed with Greg and his team. Everyone and everything was right where it needed to be â€“ music faded in at the right times and faded out at the right times, just immaculate. 2) Attention to Detail â€“ we also had Greg do lighting and he made the room and reception really look amazing. The guy just knows how to turn a room into whatever ambience the bride and groom want, and can read a situation perfectly. 3) Reception Music â€“ as is standard with Greg, he worked with us to go through our music choices in advance but we really just gave him themes. What he did with our suggestions was incredible â€“ weâ€™ve received more compliments about the music and the dancing than any other part of the wedding! He played every jam at just the right time and could anticipate where the crowd was going and would change the music accordingly. Just magical.\r\n\r\nExtra â€“ Greg is also a musician! We had him on sax and a pianist play at our cocktail hour and it was fantastic! Provided a great vibe for the hour and was very very cool.\r\n\r\nSummary â€“ again, HIRE C-ZONE AND GREG! I canâ€™t capture everything positive I would like to say in just one review, but my hope is that this encourages every bride/groom to be to consider Greg and C-Zone as an option. You will not regret it!\r\n</p><p class="from">Lauren &amp; Jeremy Bamsch // Wedding // Liberty Hotel</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p>\r\nC-Zone was exactly what we wanted in a vendor, they were professional, responsive, courteous, helpful, flexible, and most of all, they delivered a high quality service in their people. Of utmost quality was the DJ that C-Zone connected us with &#8211; Mike Paganelli. We never worked with a DJ before so didnâ€™t know what to expect, but Mike made our entire music and entertainment experience exceptional. I first met with Mike for our initial consultation about seven months before our wedding day, and what struck me most was how genuine Mike was, and how much he cared about making everything perfect. He took the time during multiple appointments to get to know us, and help us think through our music choices and the flow of our ceremony. Mike laid out his vision for how to make not only a memorable evening for us, but also a fantastic evening for our guests. Mike helped us understand how to put order to the night, helped us understand the context of music for the cocktail hour versus dinner versus dancing, and was able to perfectly match the music to the theme of our night. On our wedding day Mike proved to be the asset that we were anticipating â€“ he was well prepared with the two music stations that we needed, he played the exact style of music we were looking for, he was well studied on the names and order of our somewhat untraditional bridal party introductions, he mastered the volume and sound checks throughout the evening, and to the pleasure of our guests, there was never a lull in the dancing. Mike knew how to read the crowd and played music that made for a great time. My wife and I never left the dance floor, nor did most of our friends and family. Mike exceeded expectations based on what we laid out, and he fully delivered on his genuine nature and portrayal of ensuring that everything went perfectly. We couldnâ€™t be happier that we hired C-Zone and Mike Paganelli &#8211; without any hesitation we give our full support and recommendation to hire them for a wedding or any event needing a DJ.</p><p class="from">TusaRebecca &amp; Stephen Pannucci // Wedding // Algonquin Club</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p>\r\nC-Zone is a top notch choice for your wedding DJ, music and entertainment. I&#8217;m a wedding planner by profession. I have seen dozens (maybe hundreds) of DJs in action and C-Zone tops the list. The owner Greg and his wife Diane manage the business and they are always available and responsive to any and all questions. C-Zone has a solid line-up and we chose Max Baun as our wedding DJ. Max is a star &#8211; he is personable and quiet but when he starts to mix tunes he can&#8217;t be beat. Max knows how to manage the party without being intrusive. He is truly there to help the celebrant have the best possible time. For us, that meant keeping the energy up and the dance floor filled. We loved every minute of it. My husband&#8217;s only regret is that we didn&#8217;t record the entire dance soundtrack so we can play it back at parties for years to come ðŸ™‚ Guess we&#8217;ll have to hire C-Zone again to come spin some tunes. Thank you Max, Greg, and Diane! You guys rock.\r\n</p><p class="from">Sarah &amp; John Narcus // Wedding // Peirce Farm at Witch Hill</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p>\r\nYou will not regret booking C-Zone for your DJ and Entertainment needs. They made the process incredibly easy for my husband and me. I loved their easy-to-use portal for adding song preferences, and also loved the fact that our DJ, Charles, really took the time to get to know us. Before we even officially selected C-Zone, he took the time to meet me and my husband at our wedding venue for our convenience, and after that, we were sold by his professionalism and how comfortable he made us feel about the entire process. From then on, Charles didn&#8217;t not cease to disappoint us on delivering an incredibly fun night!! Charles took the time to meet with us again before the wedding day, to ensure all the little details were checked off and ensuring he had the right direction of what we wanted for the night. Intentionally, my husband and I left some room on the playlist for Charles to &#8220;play along with the crowd&#8221;, and he did an awesome awesome job. The dance floor was occupied the entire night, and we got so many rave reviews from our guests that &#8220;the music was on point&#8221; and the &#8220;DJ was amazing&#8221;. Charles also did a perfect job with all the announcements we needed, and was able to accommodate some ad hoc shifts we needed throughout the night. We really cannot say enough nice things about C-zone and Charles in particular. We would recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable, professional, and trustworthy entertainment provider for a very reasonable price &#8212; and highly highly recommend asking for Charles!\r\n</p><p class="from">Victoria &amp; AJ Esguerra // Wedding // Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p>\r\nWe are so thankful that we chose C-Zone to create the soundtrack for our wedding day. The musicians that played for cocktail hour were so talented and chose the most amazing music to get everything off to a great start! Not only did our DJ Kevin Cusson, keep everyone on the dance floor, he also helped coordinate the night to be sure everything was on schedule. The energy on the dance floor was palpable and all our guests raved about the music and complained of aching feet the next day. We interviewed several entertainment companies prior to choosing C- Zone. We found them to be extremely kind, professional and always answered any questions in a very timely manner. The owners take such pride in what they do and they do it well. If youâ€™re looking for someone to provide entertainment for your wedding- the search should end here!\r\n</p><p class="from">Gina &amp; Joe Crowley // Wedding // Hammond Castle </p></div>\r\n\r\n</section>',title:"Testimonials",date:"July 16, 2016",excerpt:'<p>Testimonials C-Zone Entertainment Read all of our wedding reviews on our C-Zone Entertainment Storefront at For those that wonâ€™t read this entire review, Iâ€™ll be plain with the first sentence â€“ HIRE C-ZONE!
