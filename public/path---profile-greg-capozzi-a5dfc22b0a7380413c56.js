In pursuing his passion for great music he left the security of a day job and put all of his savings and resources into purchasing a state-of-the-art digital sound system, taught himself how to DJ, and started knocking on doors. Being a musician for his entire professional career that began in the early 1990&#8217;s, the transition was seamless. Soon the public recognized C-Zone&#8217;s talent and what started as a one man show has flourished into a full production company offering 12 DJs, multiple jazz and classical ensembles and some amazing lighting options. He is incredibly proud to have built this company from the ground up with nothing but hard work, dedication, persistence, passion and of course talent.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>As a DJ/Emcee, C-Zone has performed at countless special events including weddings, corporate functions, private parties, and much more. He currently performs at over 125 parties annually, mostly weddings and high-end corporate affairs. He has held residencies in some of Boston&#8217;s hottest venues including Felt, Umbria, Mantra and Pravda (now Gipsy Bar). And let&#8217;s not forget a few private parties for Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn during the filming of Mystic River. C-Zone&#8217;s personality, professionalism, and ability to keep the dance floor moving make him the ideal choice for your event.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p><br />\nAs a saxophone and woodwind player, C-Zone has performed all over the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean with appearances at The Montreal Jazz Festival, Disney World, Epcot Center, Club Med, Carnival Cruise Lines, and a guest appearance with performers from Cirque de Soleil.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Some highlights of C-Zone&#8217;s career include a 5 year tenure with Rippopotamus, voted &#8220;Best Funk Band&#8221; at the Boston Music Awards in 1996. This 8 piece all original funk/rock band routinely packed clubs such as The Middle East, Mama Kin, and Ryles. In the fall of 1996, one of Rippo&#8217;s songs was selected as the theme for &#8220;Singled Out,&#8221; a popular dating show on MTV. In 1998 Rippo performed at the internationally famous Montreal Jazz Festival, and rang in the New Year in 2000 with a week long stint at Jimmy Buffet&#8217;s Margaritaville in Key West, FL.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>More recently C-Zone has been working as an underground recording artist with some local and national record producers of dance music. One of his saxophone solos has been featured on Plastic City Records which specializes in House music. The same track was featured on a compilation called Sunrise at ES Cavallet in Ibiza in 2009. This is an incredible accomplishment since Ibiza is the number one destination for dance music in the world.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>C-Zone is not your average DJ. As a musician he hears and thinks about music differently and his unique approach has profound results on the dance floor. He will rock your cocktail and/or dinner set on his sax and pack your dance floor with his beats&#8230;</p></div></p>\n',title:"Greg Capozzi",acf:{title:"DJ, Emcee, Sax",video:"",facebook:"https://www.facebook.com/greg.capozzi.7",instagram:"http://instagram.com/czonemusic",testimonials:'<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe seriously cannot rave enough about Greg Capozzi! My husband and I got married this August and having a packed dance floor was a top priority for us! From start to finish, Greg absolutely crushed it and brought the energy we were dreaming of for our wedding night. The vibe was perfect from the very first song — smooth transitions, amazing song choices, and a seamless flow that kept everyone on the dance floor all night long. Our guests are STILL talking about how much fun they had and how incredible the music was. From the throwbacks to the current hits to the special moments we requested, everything was timed perfectly. </p>\n<p>Not only did he have an amazing dance set ready to go for us, but he was also incredible on the microphone, MC’ing the whole event! He took care of all our formalities and had everyone prepared and ready to go! And he made us feel comfortable and energized for our reception introductions and our first dance! He read the room like a pro and knew exactly when to hype it up or slow it down for those special moments. Plus, he is so easy and fun to work with — professional, responsive, and clearly passionate about creating an unforgettable experience. You can tell by working with Greg that he knows exactly what he’s doing! I work with a lot of different DJs for my job, and the whole team at C-Zone is just incredible. If you want your dance floor packed and your guests raving about how much fun they had, C-Zone is the way to go! You’ll be so glad you did. We truly couldn’t have asked for more!</p>\n<p></p><p class="from">Julia and Patrick, Floriana and The Hellenic Center, 8.1.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nEnergizing, Unique, Creative. Greg came highly recommended to us from both our wedding planner and our venue independently. We could immediately see why. Greg has a vast knowledge and mastery of his craft and managing the process. We wanted a string trio for our ceremony. Greg arranged that and the microphones for our wedding, all of which were orchestrated to perfection. We wanted to make sure our parents and our friends all had a reason to dance. Greg was flexible in working with us on a set list that had everything from Ke$ha to The Emotions, seamlessly integrated into an experience that made the evening flow. He even did a custom edit of &#8220;The Only Exception&#8221; by Paramore to ensure our first dance was special. On top of all of this, Greg played saxophone during cocktail hour, and it put the evening into the highest gear. The Yacht Rock saxophone setlist underscored cocktail hour with a relaxed vibe, while not being intrusive to the guests conversing. Greg is a huge reason our wedding was the best day of our lives, and we would recommend him to any couple.<br />\n</p><p class="from">David and Heather, The Mansion on Turner Hill, 8.23.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nIf you want your wedding reception to be the best wedding your guests have ever attended then look no further! I have had the pleasure of working with Greg for 20 plus years in the corporate environment, but this summer I had the absolute honor of Greg entertaining our friends and family at our wedding. From the sax as he played our wedding party down the aisle, to hosting duties including introductions, speeches, toasts, first dances and cake, to keeping the dance floor full and bumping from the beginning to the end. Greg is the best in the business for a reason. He is super responsive, full of deep experience, on top of industry trends, extremely professional and personable. You will fall in love with Greg! Take my word for it! You need not look any further!!! Thank you Greg for making our wedding day perfect. We will be talking about it forever and so will our guests!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Kiralee and Patrick, 6.28.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nGreg &#038; Di are masters of energy, timing, and emotion. They brought our daughter’s June wedding celebration to life, at our home in Wellesley, with a perfect blend of professionalism, warmth, and artistry. Greg’s music knowledge spans every genre and generation, keeping everyone—from grandparents to college friends—on the dance floor. He read the crowd flawlessly, adjusting tempo and energy in real time. The sound quality was phenomenal, and his lighting setup transformed our backyard tent into a dreamlike atmosphere—like northern lights dancing overhead. </p>\n<p>Greg’s MC presence was charismatic and natural—hip, clear, and perfectly timed. He struck the right balance between being engaging and letting the celebration roll. Thoughtful and humble, he listened closely to the couple’s wishes—even letting my daughter play her own playlist until she joyfully handed the reins back for our unforgettable father-daughter dance to Harvest Moon. Greg &#038; Di tuned into every emotional beat of the evening with empathy and grace. Their adaptability and confidence kept the celebration flowing effortlessly, always elevating the mood without ever stealing the spotlight. From start to finish, Greg &#038; Di radiated positivity, calm, and authenticity. When the energy dipped, they knew exactly how to reignite the dance floor with charm and skill. Greg &#038; Di didn’t just play music—they created moments we’ll treasure forever. If you want a wedding that feels personal, alive, and truly magical, C-Zone delivers.</p>\n<p></p><p class="from">Kara & Matt, June 2025, Wellesley, MA (Private Residence)</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.302734375,src:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg",srcSet:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-2c2fe.jpeg 110w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-a2e2b.jpeg 220w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg 440w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-77eb3.jpeg 660w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-78eca.jpeg 880w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-6ece6.jpeg 1320w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg 2001w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg"},full:{src:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg",height:307,width:400,srcSet:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg 1x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-738fa.jpeg 1.5x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-4042a.jpeg 2x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-935ac.jpeg 3x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"8bf0629c-1ea8-5945-b721-7260a9ed3018"}}}});
