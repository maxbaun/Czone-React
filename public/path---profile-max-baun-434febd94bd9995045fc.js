Max  made our wedding reception better than we could have ever dreamed! From the moment dinner started with the perfect yacht rock vibe to the final song of the night, he absolutely nailed it. Max took our vision and brought it to life in a way that was even better than we’d imagined! Our guests can’t stop raving about the dance floor – several of them even said it was the best they’ve ever experienced. And we’d have to agree! Thanks to Max’s incredible song choices and seamless transitions, the dance floor was packed all night. Every track was a hit, keeping the energy up and the fun going strong. If you’re looking for a DJ who understands your vision, brings incredible energy, and truly knows how to keep a party going, Max and C-Zone Entertainment are the absolute best choice. We can’t thank him enough for helping make our big day so unforgettable!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Mykela and Patrick, 9.21.24, Omni Parker House</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe chose C-Zone to provide the entertainment for our wedding and we are beyond pleased with our selection! Classical music has always had a way of calming my nerves, so I knew I wanted that to be playing as I walked down the aisle. The violinist, Lynne, played beautifully and helped me stay calm as I listened to her play while waiting for the ceremony to begin. We also got to preview Max’s music style while getting ready, creating excitement! We love different genres of music and we wanted our reception to be filled with iconic songs from different decades of music. </p>\n<p>The online portal helped provide us with a vast song selection that we could choose from. We were able to meet with Max over the phone so that he got a feel for our music taste and personalities and we could do that same. Max was able to take our song picks and added them to his own artistic playlist and it was an absolute hit! He provided the classics from the 70s to now, and our guests young and old enjoyed every second of it! He even provided slow songs for the guests who didn’t dance to fast paced music, and Latin music for my side of the family, that all guests were able to enjoy. I was able to look around at different points of the night and see all my guests on the dance floor, and that’s all we could have ever wanted out of our reception! Max even provided us a dropbox with our key songs of the night. Two weeks after the wedding, I am still listening to those songs on repeat! We greatly appreciate all the hard work put in by all those at C-Zone who helped provide the most memorable entertainment for our summer 2024 wedding!</p>\n<p></p><p class="from">Samantha and Dominic, 6.22.24, The Westbrook Inn</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nI have to admit I was someone who wanted a band only, my husband wanted a DJ. We compromised and picked C-Zone for their ability to do live instrumentals for the ceremony and cocktail hour, and a DJ for the reception. Not having been to any C-Zone events, I was wondering how this experience would go. Max Baun was AMAZING! He was prompt, would schedule calls and put them in my calendar (I love an agenda), and arrived right on time. He asked all the right questions to get the vibe, and he absolutely nailed it. He was very receptive to songs we wanted, and was able to also fill in songs we didn&#8217;t even know we needed. His transitions were so perfect, our guests had no choice but to stay on the dance floor as he played hit after hit after hit. I would 100% request Max for any event I will do in the future, and recommend C-Zone whole heartedly.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Chelsey and Brian, 1.13.24, The Beauport Hotel</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nA Night to Remember &#8211; Incredible DJ and String Musicians! We recently had the pleasure of hiring C-Zone DJ Max Baun and a team of string musicians for our wedding, and we couldn&#8217;t be happier with the exceptional service they provided.
