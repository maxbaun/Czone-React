A natural entertainer, she grew up singing, dancing, and playing musical instruments to the delight of audiences at every level. Kate started her DJ career at summer camp when she was 13 years old. A DJ let her prepare all the entertainment for a party, including the playlist. The party was a huge success! At 15, Kate followed her passion to Music College, graduating four years later with a wealth of knowledge and valuable experience. Known professionally as DJ Kay Bay, Kate always puts her customers first. She will create a custom playlist, based on your music preferences, special for you. She can even create a simple or complex mix for your first dance. Kate coordinates with everyone involved to make your event a resounding success! Kate has performed at weddings, proms, birthday parties, and community celebrations in greater Boston, throughout New England and in UK, London.
