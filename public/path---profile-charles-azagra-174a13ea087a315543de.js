At age 11 he began studying piano which trained his ear to hear melodies and harmonies. As a young adult, he developed his DJ skills while working at a recording studio. Being surrounded by amazing musicians as they conducted their studio sessions fed more into his understanding of musical styles.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Possessing a keen ear for how music and songs are structured, coupled with his vast knowledge of different genres across the decades, makes Charles a well versed DJ capable of reading any crowd in any situation.

Charles was awesome to work with! Every step of the process was seamless from the multiple FaceTime calls we had with him leading up to the day to make sure everything was just how we wanted it, to offering his professional advice on different things. He helped make out perfect wedding day even better! There was never a time that the dance floor wasn’t full of people from the time it opened to the last song of the night. He took a few requests and worked them in, but also kept the flow of the music from one song to the next seamless so it all fit together and kept everyone dancing all night! As one of the groomsman said who doesn’t usually dance, “the vibes were immaculate” and we have Charles to thank for that. We highly recommend going with C-Zone entertainment and Charles as your DJ!!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Sabrina + Justin // Wedding // Wychmere Beach Club // June 2023</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nBest day of our lives! Charles was brilliant as our wedding DJ. He managed the dance floor extremely well, ensuring that all of our favorites were played in a way that maximized the fun, and kept the party going throughout the evening. He also provided equipment and advice to ensure that our best man was able to perform our first dance song live, and smoothly transitioned between live music and DJing. Our guests had the most amazing night!</p>\n<p>Czone Entertainment was great to work with throughout the planning process. They provided a very detailed questionnaire to inform the planning process and an easy interface to request and suggest the songs we wanted played, as well as useful and timely reminders in making necessary decisions.</p>\n<p>We absolutely recommend Charles and Czone Entertainment to anyone in the Boston area planning a wedding or party; our wedding was the best day of our lives, and the music and dancing was a huge part of what made it perfect!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Julie + Morgan // Wedding // Willowdale Estate // April 2023</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nOur DJ Charles was incredible!!! We had many compliments about the variety of music played, there was something for everybody at our reception to dance to. The dance floor was full with people the full night! Communication with everyone at C-Zone was seamless; they were always quick to respond and thorough with answering our questions. We also booked a jazz duo for our cocktail hour and the musicians were very talented and perfectly matched the vibe we were hoping for at our event. Cannot say enough good things about C-Zone and the talent they represent!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Renee + Steven // Wedding // Willowdale Estate // January 2023</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nHaving great music for everyone to enjoy was a priority for us and completed our wedding. C-Zone Entertainment truly listened to our vision and connected us with the talents that best suited us. Jane Potter, an accomplished pianist and vocalist, welcomed our guest to the venue and ceremony by setting a romantic melodic air for the day. For the processional, she shared her heartfelt and moving rendition of “A Thousand Years”. As I walked down the aisle, the moment was perfect and all that I had envisioned it would be thanks to Jane! Not only are her musical talents beyond compare, she is professional, open to requests, responsive and warm. The Jazz Trio was equally fantastic performing during the cocktail hour and dinner. They truly knocked it out of the park and set the perfect vibe! DJ Charles Azagra then took over and kept us on the dance floor all night with his seamless blending of one great song into the next. He worked with us to truly make the reception all that we had hoped for by accommodating our personal preferences, along with some unique dance requests, without losing a beat. He was so fun and easy to work with, very professional, responsive, and personable. We would highly recommend the C-Zone Team!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Susan + James // Wedding // Shalin Liu Performance Center // October 2022</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe heard about C-Zone Entertainment from a &#8220;trusted vendors&#8221; list provided by our wedding venue, and we have nothing but great things to say about them! Gina and team were wonderful to work with from start to finish &#8211; they are organized, professional, responsive, patient and transparent. We chose a guitar duo to start our night, which Gina and her team chose to suit our music style. It was a great touch to our ceremony, and we would highly recommend using one of C-Zone&#8217;s live music groups in your event (there are lots of options). We worked with DJ Charles for the majority of our wedding (cocktail hour and reception), and can we just say, he is AMAZING! Not only did he help the night flow smoothly by keeping us on schedule, but he created the best party environment! When we met with DJ Charles prior to our wedding, we told him we wanted music that our guests could sing along and dance to. We wanted people up on the dance floor all night and he did not disappoint! Two weeks later, and our guests are still raving about him! If you&#8217;re looking for an entertainment company that has it all, C-Zone Entertainment will not let you down!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Bridget + Ian // Wedding // Alden Castle // October 2022</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nC-Zone was the perfect choice for our wedding, specifically DJ Charles! He kept our guests dancing all night long &#8212; we had to tell people to leave! Our guests raved about the music choices Charles made. He was incredibly professional and responsive throughout the planning process. He met with us to better understand our style and music taste, and C-Zone’s online planning tool made our song selections easy. Charles accommodated our special requests, like cutting a line out of our first dance song and combining our parent dances into one song. He helped communicate to guests during the event (for example, announcing the cake cutting) but he did not “over communicate” as some DJs do. The star of the show was the music itself. C-Zone also provided uplighting for our reception space. I was skeptical at first, but the uplighting was 100% the right choice! It totally transformed the space and it was easy to change light colors during the event, from neutral tones during dinner to fun colors during the dance party. The C-Zone team was great to work with every step of the way, and Diane and the administrative team made our payment and contract processes organized and easy. We highly recommend Charles and C-Zone!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Katie & Alex, The Harvard Club, 10.12.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Amazing vendor!</h3>\n<p>We booked C-Zone at the recommendation of our venue manager, and we are so thrilled we did! C-Zone has multiple DJs that work with them, ours was Charles. He was absolutely fabulous. He has a super laid back personality and was professional, responsive, and fun to work with from the very beginning. We met him before booking C-Zone (in person because we happened to live close by, otherwise he is available over skype) and talked about what kind of music we like and what we were envisioning for our evening. After we met him, there was no doubt we&#8217;d be hiring C-Zone! He told us about their online planning tool, which would make it easy to indicate songs we definitely did (or did not) want. It made for a very seamless planning process! We also hired a string duet to play during our ceremony, which made the event so classy and unforgettable! Finally, at the very last minute (like, a week before the wedding), I decided that I wanted to add uplights for the reception. Despite the last minute change, Diane, C-Zone&#8217;s office administrator, helped us make it happen. C-Zone was a joy to work with from beginning to end and we highly recommend them!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Kelly & Ryan, Turner Hill, 9.20.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Charles is the BEST DJ ever!</h3>\n<p>Our wedding was a PARTYYYY and we have Charles from C-Zone to thank for that. The dance floor was literally packed all night and so many people came up to us to say that this was hands-down the best DJ they had ever heard. Charles reads the room and keeps the party going and does it all through his music. He&#8217;s a great emcee as well but doesn&#8217;t spend all night yammering into the mic. It helps that he is also a total sweetheart and answered our many questions during the planning process (same goes for the rest of the C-Zone staff who replied to my many emails). We are seriously trying to think of another reason for a big party that we can hire Charles for. He&#8217;s the best!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Meaghan & Paul, Private Estate, 9.1.19</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.1843434343434343,src:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-d23fc.png",srcSet:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-1b2f3.png 110w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-d29cd.png 220w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-d23fc.png 440w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-54e74.png 660w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-e4770.png 880w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-956df.png 1320w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-3a4a8.png 1876w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-3a4a8.png"},full:{src:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-37095.png",height:338,width:400,srcSet:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-37095.png 1x,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-99bcd.png 1.5x,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-603c4.png 2x,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-acdf4.png 3x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"c392ef9a-6ba0-548f-8338-c1bb5d70b02a"}}}});
