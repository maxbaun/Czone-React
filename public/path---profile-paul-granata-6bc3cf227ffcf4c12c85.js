He completely immersed himself in all aspects of what music is. Whether it be the instrumentation, melody, production or personal interpretation, it all had a profound affect on him that he used to develop a keen ear and understanding of how powerful a song can be.</p></div></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>He taught himself to play guitar and dedicated himself so much to the instrument and music he would soon progress to writing and recording his own songs. At Northeastern University, he graduated with a major in Music Industry and also started an original band that played extensively throughout the Northeast. Soon after graduating, Paul and the band moved to Los Angeles where they continued to perform and record. During this time, he also spent 9 years working professionally in the music industry for Realsongs &#8211; Diane Warren Music Publishing.</p></div></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>At Realsongs some of the areas he worked in included licensing, copyright, song catalog management, as well as work in the recording studios.</p></div></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;"><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Paul is very personable and easy to work with.

From our very first consultation, we could tell that C-Zone was a professional and reliable vendor. Paul came recommended to us by multiple family members, and we had also attended a few weddings where Paul was the DJ. He listened to all of our requests, and made the entire process stress-free. We were able to make some last minute changes and Paul was extremely flexible and understanding. Gina was a great resource for coordinating logistics and keeping us organized. We had a conflict with our 3rd party cocktail hour musician, and when we came to Gina with our conflict she quickly resolved it for us and found us a fantastic keyboardist to play during our cocktail hour. Shane was extremely talented &#8211; many of our guests raved about him! Thank you again to the entire C-Zone team for a wonderful night.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Sarah and Richie, Newport Harbor Island Resort, 11.1.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe worked with C-Zone&#8217;s Paul Granata for our wedding and it was a flawless experience! The mics for speeches and our ceremony were just there, working without issue and we didn&#8217;t even have to think about it – exactly how you want it. As for the dance floor, we absolutely loved how Paul brought our suggested songs to life. We danced for over 2 hours straight and so did all our friends! We received comments from several guests that it was the best dance floor they&#8217;ve ever seen at a wedding. And we agree! Paul and Gina were also very friendly to us so the experience was great all around. 10/10 highly recommend!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">David and Kara, Fruitlands Museum, 8.31.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nDJ Paul and all of the C-Zone staff were absolutely incredible. Paul had DJ’ed my friend’s wedding so I knew he would throw an amazing party, but I didn’t realize how smooth the planning process would be. From my first emails with Gina to our planning sessions with Paul, everything was seamless and professional and didn’t add any additional stress to the insanity that is wedding planning. Paul listened to everything we wanted and we couldn’t have asked for anything better! Our dance floor was filled literally all night. His sense of humor was a great addition as well. In addition to awesome DJ services (including uplighting) we also had a jazz trio for our cocktail hour and a Photo Booth &#8211; both were the cherry on top of our perfect night. The day after our wedding all the pictures from the photo booth were emailed directly to us &#8211; this was an awesome addition. Prices for all of these services were very reasonable. I cannot say enough good things about DJ Paul and C-Zone Entertainment!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Katharine and Stephen, The Barn at Gibbet Hill, 2.8.25</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.3930348258706469,src:"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-77eb3.jpg 660w,\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-78eca.jpg 880w,\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-e50fc.jpg 1120w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-e50fc.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-10d9a.jpg",height:287,width:400,srcSet:"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-738fa.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-4042a.jpg 2x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"6e10bb9d-cde9-52de-a5f2-41c1a9e2cb5f"}}}});
