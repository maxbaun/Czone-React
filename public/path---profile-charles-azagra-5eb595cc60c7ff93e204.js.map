He was incredibly professional and responsive throughout the planning process. He met with us to better understand our style and music taste, and C-Zone’s online planning tool made our song selections easy. Charles accommodated our special requests, like cutting a line out of our first dance song and combining our parent dances into one song. He helped communicate to guests during the event (for example, announcing the cake cutting) but he did not “over communicate” as some DJs do. The star of the show was the music itself. C-Zone also provided uplighting for our reception space. I was skeptical at first, but the uplighting was 100% the right choice! It totally transformed the space and it was easy to change light colors during the event, from neutral tones during dinner to fun colors during the dance party. The C-Zone team was great to work with every step of the way, and Diane and the administrative team made our payment and contract processes organized and easy.

C-Zone has multiple DJs that work with them, ours was Charles. He was absolutely fabulous. He has a super laid back personality and was professional, responsive, and fun to work with from the very beginning. We met him before booking C-Zone (in person because we happened to live close by, otherwise he is available over skype) and talked about what kind of music we like and what we were envisioning for our evening. After we met him, there was no doubt we&#8217;d be hiring C-Zone! He told us about their online planning tool, which would make it easy to indicate songs we definitely did (or did not) want. It made for a very seamless planning process! We also hired a string duet to play during our ceremony, which made the event so classy and unforgettable! Finally, at the very last minute (like, a week before the wedding), I decided that I wanted to add uplights for the reception. Despite the last minute change, Diane, C-Zone&#8217;s office administrator, helped us make it happen. C-Zone was a joy to work with from beginning to end and we highly recommend them!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Kelly & Ryan, Turner Hill, 9.20.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Charles is the BEST DJ ever!</h3>\\n<p>Our wedding was a PARTYYYY and we have Charles from C-Zone to thank for that.
