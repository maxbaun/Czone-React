Paul DJ’ed my friend’s wedding so I knew he would throw an amazing party, but I didn’t realize how smooth the planning process would be. From my first emails with Gina, to our planning sessions with Paul, everything was seamless and professional and didn’t add any additional stress to the insanity that is wedding planning. </p>\\n<p>Paul listened to everything we wanted and we couldn’t have asked for anything better! Our dance floor was filled literally all night. His sense of humor was a great addition as well. In addition to awesome DJ services (including uplighting) we also had a jazz trio for our cocktail hour and a Photo Booth &#8211; both were the cherry on top of our perfect night. The day after our wedding all the pictures from the photo booth were emailed directly to us &#8211; this was an awesome addition. Prices for all of these services were very reasonable.

We met with him several times before our date to go over our must-play list and fill out all the other music details like first-dance song, last few songs of the night, etc. After talking with him a couple weeks before the wedding, it was clear he understood our vision and had a plan for the entire night. C-Zone&#8217;s online planning portal was easy to use for uploading our preferred playlist too.
