At age 11 he began studying piano which trained his ear to hear melodies and harmonies. As a young adult, he developed his DJ skills while working at a recording studio. Being surrounded by amazing musicians as they conducted their studio sessions fed more into his understanding of musical styles.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Possessing a keen ear for how music and songs are structured, coupled with his vast knowledge of different genres across the decades, makes Charles a well versed DJ capable of reading any crowd in any situation. His mixes range from all decades from the 50s to today, ensuring that everyone on the dance floor will hear feel good music that is familiar to them.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Aside from his busy schedule performing at wedding, corporate and private events, Charles has performed as A DJ throughout the Northeast at nightclubs such as Whisky Saigon, West End Johnnies, Storyville, Wonder Bar, Lawn on D, Down Ultra Lounge, Alibi, Murphy&#8217;s (Salem)  Rebel Lounge (Providence), and Whiskey Republic (Providence) just to name a few.</p></div></p>\n',title:"Charles Azagra",acf:{title:"DJ, Emcee",video:"https://youtu.be/U3T8vrpYStQ?si=eJTiF0dqNoJ2HPFi",facebook:"https://www.facebook.com/charles.azagra",instagram:"https://www.instagram.com/czonecharles/",testimonials:'<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe met Charles Azagra from C-Zone Entertainment at one of our friend’s weddings and we loved him! He was so sweet, not cheesy at all, and absolutely rocked the dance floor. Everyone agreed he was awesome, and our other friends ended up booking him for their wedding a few months later. We again had an absolute blast, and knew we would definitely be going with him for our 2024 Christmas wedding. Charles was amazing!!! </p>\n<p>He had great recommendations, our meetings with him were perfect, he completely understood what we were going for and he absolutely delivered. His sound system was great, the uplighting he set up was stunning, and the audio for our videographer was perfect. He played all the songs we wanted to hear and while we didn’t have too much on our “do not play” list, he 100% understood the vibe and we were so thrilled with the music. When some of the older generation guests wanted to hear some oldies, he was able to pivot on the spot and made sure everyone was out on the dance floor all night. We would choose Charles 10 out of 10 times. Book him! You won’t regret it!!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Jennifer + Patrick, 12.20.24 Ocean Cliff Resort</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe hired Charles (DJ Chizzy) from C-Zone Entertainment for our wedding, and he was absolutely incredible! We first saw him perform at a friend&#8217;s wedding and knew immediately that we wanted him for our big day. He did not disappoint! DJ Charles is hands-down the best wedding DJ we&#8217;ve ever experienced. He has an amazing ability to keep the dance floor packed all night long, reading the crowd perfectly and creating an unforgettable party atmosphere. </p>\n<p>Beyond his talent, he&#8217;s also friendly, professional, experienced and incredibly easy to work with. From start to finish, Charles made the process seamless and stress-free. If you&#8217;re looking for a DJ who will make your wedding a night to remember, look no further than Charles and C-Zone Entertainment. A profile of all 5-star reviews says a lot, and we agree &#8211; highly, highly recommend!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Christina and Ranson, 6.14.24, Blithewold Mansion</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nC-Zone was an absolute pleasure to work with and had a huge role in the success and joy of our big day. From our initial correspondences with Gina it was clear we were in good hands. We had a great phone call with her, and she quickly connected us with the DJ she thought would be best for us, DJ Charles Azagra. We spoke to him over the phone and it was obvious he was our guy. Throughout the planning process he went above and beyond, fielding emails and calls from us as we came up with new ideas for our ceremony and reception music. He even spoke with our officiant before the wedding, who also sang during our ceremony, so they could go over some of the specific needs for the day. Our officiant loved working with Charles just as much as we did &#8211; he really put us all at ease with his kindness and expertise. </p>\n<p>When it came time to dance Charles not only made sure the floor was packed all night, but he also clearly read the room and got some of the guests who we did not expect to see dancing out there. He also accommodated our cultural requests &#8212; we had a blast dancing the hora (which our officiant also accompanied) and loved seeing our Russian relatives singing along to songs from their childhood. C-Zone&#8217;s portal and planning tools were also immensely helpful and made our lives so much easier. All in all, we are so thrilled with our decision to work with C-Zone and DJ Charles and can not recommend them enough!</p>\n<p></p><p class="from">Amy and Bob, 8.24.24, Nonantum Resort</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nC-Zone was an absolute pleasure to work with and had a huge role in the success and joy of our big day.
