The client portal was very helpful and everything went smoothly. We had DJ Corey who is so down to earth and really made us feel confident during the process. He nailed it with the music and I was thrilled he put his own take on some of the songs we had on the playlist. We are so happy we had him as our DJ! Thank you Corey for making our night so much fun!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Megan and Jeff, 9.30.23, Renaissance Patriot Place</p></div><br />\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe had Corey for our wedding on 9/3/2023. He was professional, fun, skilled  and perhaps most important of all FLEXIBLE. He made adjustments last minute, absolutely rocked the music choices and followed my (the groom’s) complex requests and obscure song selections. He really tailored it to what we wanted &#8212; not too much time on the mic, letting the music play and keeping the vibes going. He made it all about my wife and me &#8212; and we are really thankful. 10/10!!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Joseph and Kayla, 9.3.23, Tupper Manor</p></div><br />\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nCorey from C-Zone Entertainment truly helped curate our best day ever for our wedding! The week of our wedding, we had a consultation to go over planning details. Not only did he have our timeline prepared, but he even created a perfect transition of 2 songs that my father and I used for our first dance….it flowed so smoothly, I was so impressed! Throughout our wedding day, he kept us informed. As an experienced DJ, he knew what songs to add to our wedding day playlist and what songs to avoid based on our preferences and he truly NAILED our playlist!! Our guests wouldn’t leave the floor! The floor was shaking!! To top it off, he even did background lighting to make our dance floor even more fun!! I would HIGHLY recommend using Corey for your wedding day or any special occasion! Thank you for helping us have the best day ever!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Callie and Sam, 8.12.23, Butternut Farm Golf Club</p></div><br />\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe used C-Zone to book a DJ for our wedding and could not be happier with how it went! From the initial consultation to the final check in, C-Zone kept everything organized and made me feel cared for every step of the way. Their online portal is a convenient and effective way to organize song preferences and keep the DJ informed about the schedule of the wedding. They were always available to answer questions and made the process of booking a DJ smooth and stress free. It was also extremely helpful to be matched with a DJ right away, this helped us build rapport and get on the same page long before the wedding. On our wedding day, DJ Corey Mitchell really came through and blew us away! Before the wedding, we told him our main goal was to have our guests on the dance floor as quickly as possible and to keep them there as long as possible. Corey achieved both with ease, incorporating a perfect mix of our must plays and his additions based on our preferences. He did such a great job that many guests asked for his card before the end of the night! Plus he was great to work with, very friendly and focused on making our wedding day exactly what we wanted. We were blown away and could not have asked for a better experience.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Patrick and Claire, 6.17.23, The Barn at Crane Estate</p></div></p>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:.9666666666666667,src:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-77eb3.jpg 660w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-78eca.jpg 880w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d928a.jpg 1160w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d928a.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-10d9a.jpg",height:414,width:400,srcSet:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-738fa.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-4042a.jpg 2x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"8daf2a19-34de-5fd2-9149-f09dcaccde28"}}}});
