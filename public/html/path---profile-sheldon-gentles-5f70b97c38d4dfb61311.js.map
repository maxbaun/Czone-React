He was professional, kept the flow of the wedding going as MC, and played non-stop hits during the reception! What we appreciated most about C-Zone and DJ ShellyShell is that they worked with us to determine what type of music we like, don’t like, and must have on our special night, aside from the music for processional, recessional, first dances, etc. We heard everything we wanted and more that night and our dance floor never dwindled because his music kept us all on the dance floor with his music mixing talents. He knew what the crowd wanted to hear and gave it to us. We received so many compliments from wedding guests that DJ Sheldon was the best they’ve ever heard! Music was very important to us on this day and we are so thankful for DJ Sheldon making sure everything was amazing. Aside from the music and talent, DJ Sheldon was very helpful when we had questions, provided suggestions for the last song of the night based on our likes, and very accommodating. For example, we realized our Wedding Party Intro list didn’t match his right at the start of the reception. He went with it and made sure it went smoothly! We are so thankful for him and C-Zone Entertainment. We will recommend them to everyone, and would love to work with them again!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Kori + Brendan // Wedding // 90FS // June 2022</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Excellent and easy to work with</h3>\\n<p>C-Zone Entertainment was recommended by our venue and we could not have been more impressed. We were planning our wedding in a different state than where we lived and C-Zone Entertainment was very flexible and made it easy for us to work with them over the phone and via email to make sure all of our needs were being met prior to the wedding. Their planning website is very well organized and allows for couples to be very detailed about what they do and do not want on their wedding day &#8211; and this was so helpful in making the night exactly what we had hoped for. We worked with DJ Sheldon specifically and he knew exactly which songs to play to keep the dancing going all night.

We had a crowded dance floor all night and Sheldon did a great job mixing in all the songs we wanted. We met with him a few months out and he picked up pretty quick what we wanted (you can tell right away he has done a lot of weddings and knows how to give people the party they want). The online forms for music selections were great and easy to complete. When the day came around Sheldon had everything running smooth and perfect.
