We used them for the entire event, which included a string quartet for our outdoor ceremony, a jazz trio for our cocktail hour, and DJ services for the reception. They also provided the audio for our outdoor ceremony (and all for a very reasonable price!). From start to finish, everything was easy and I felt confident. Music was incredibly important to us and to have a mix of live and recorded music throughout the night flow so seamlessly was amazing! The set-up online portal, administrative staff, everyone was available and kind, and it was stress-free! All the live musicians were excellent, played what we wanted, were professional, and incredibly talented. In particular, our night was made PERFECT because of Paul Granata. He was incredibly thoughtful, kind, organized, and accommodating. I had a special song planned for my husband and he worked with me and my pianist for weeks ahead of time to make sure it was perfect. Additionally, he met with us EARLY in the day to do a sound check and rehearsal in the space all while keeping this a surprise for my husband. He still claims it was the most special part of the wedding and this was due to Paul‚Äôs assistance. Paul also helped us edit our wedding song to get the best parts of the song and keep it under 2 minutes. He is a song editing genius! Paul was great at feeling out the crowd. The few times I ran up to him to say ‚Äúcan we play XX song?‚Äùhis reply was ‚ÄúHa &#8211; it‚Äôs already cued up next!‚Äù It was amazing how intuitive and thoughtful he was the entire time. Seriously &#8211; the best hire of our vendor team. C-Zone and Paul were amazing and we cannot say enough awesome things about them! Do yourself a favor and hire them!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Danielle & Matthew, Exchange Conference Center, 8.10.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Excellent experience with C-Zone</h3>\\n<p>C-Zone was so easy to work with! Diane, the Office Administrator, was so kind and flexible whenever we had questions. We hired C-Zone for our ceremony music (piano), cocktail hour (piano &#038; sax), photo booth, and DJ (ceremony mics and reception). Our pianist was so flexible and learned three custom arrangements for our wedding that were absolutely perfect. While we were taking pictures during cocktail hour and didn&#8217;t get to experience the music ourselves, our guests told us that the duet was wonderful. The photo booth and attendant were so much fun and they provided a guest book for guests to stick their photos and write us notes which was just icing on the cake. Guests said this was the best photo booth they&#8217;d ever used because the props were so fun, the photos were so high quality, and everyone in the picture was able to get copies emailed or texted to them immediately. Our DJ was Paul and he was amazing to work with. He was so friendly and also so organized that we knew we didn&#8217;t have to worry about anything. He asked such detailed questions when we talked and was so careful to pronounce our wedding party&#8217;s names correctly and take care of all the little things, it really helped us feel totally relaxed. He gave us suggestions for some of our songs and he was spot on. Overall, we had an excellent experience with everyone from C-Zone.<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Alexandra & Thomas, Grand View, 9.14.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>Talented and Accommodating</h3>\\n<p>Paul Granata went above and beyond during our entire engagement process! C-Zone has the bride and groom fill out an online form so that everyone is on the same page. Once we completed that, Paul took the reins and made sure he knew the type of music and style of dance both of us, and our guests would enjoy. What really made Paul the best fit for us was the fact that he played multiple instruments. While we decided to not have him play guitar during the ceremony, he was willing and able to meet with my uncle, who was going to be singing, to produce a one-of-a-kind piece for when I walked down the aisle.<br />\\nPaul also edited songs for the father/daughter and first dance, making our visions truly come to life. Even though we were probably one of his many weddings, he made us feel like we were the only clients around. He would set up 1-2 hour phone calls to go over every detail and even helped us put a spreadsheet together for all the events on the wedding day.<br />\\nI hope in the future, we can work with Paul again and tap into his musical talent a little more because I know our guests would have really enjoyed that!<br />\\nThank you Paul and C-Zone üôÇ<br />\\nShannon &#038; Jordan<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Shannon & Jordan, Charles River Museum of Industry, 9.1.19</p></div>\\n\"},\"image\":{\"localFile\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"thumbnail\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.3930348258706469,\"src\":\"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-d0643.jpg\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-d0643.jpg 440w,\\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-77eb3.jpg 660w,\\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-78eca.jpg 880w,\\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-e50fc.jpg 1120w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\",\"originalImg\":\"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-e50fc.jpg\"},\"full\":{\"src\":\"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-10d9a.jpg\",\"height\":287,\"width\":400,\"srcSet\":\"/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-10d9a.jpg 1x,\\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-738fa.jpg 1.5x,\\n/static/03b394dc6dbfc8242943c3ef28e2dde3-839b34f5b7f1ad57433ae35ac5ea0fd9-4042a.jpg 2x\"}}}},\"yoast\":{\"title\":\"\",\"canonical\":\"\",\"metaDescription\":\"\",\"linkdex\":\"\",\"metakeywords\":\"\",\"noIndex\":\"\",\"noFollow\":\"\",\"meta_robots_adv\":\"\",\"metaKeywords\":\"\",\"redirect\":\"\",\"ogTitle\":\"\",\"ogDescription\":\"\",\"ogImage\":\"\",\"twitterTitle\":\"\",\"twitterDescription\":\"\",\"twitterImage\":\"\"}},\"site\":{\"id\":\"Site\",\"siteMeta\":{\"title\":\"C-Zone Entertainment\",\"subtitle\":\"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"6e10bb9d-cde9-52de-a5f2-41c1a9e2cb5f\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---profile-paul-granata-d28b7910ef38ab42bd60.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"profile\":{\"id\":\"6e10bb9d-cde9-52de-a5f2-41c1a9e2cb5f\",\"content\":\"<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><div class=\\\"content-block  text-center\\\"><p>From a young age Paul showed an extreme passion and love for music.
