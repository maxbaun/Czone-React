He did such a great job that we even had one guest ask for his card before the end of the night!

We had a string quartet for our ceremony, a DJ for our cocktail hour and reception, and a photobooth at the reception. The team at C-Zone were easy to work with, responsive to our communications and questions, and they were incredibly flexible as we made adjustments throughout the planning process. The client portal is intuitive to use and it’s seamless for adding and changing specific details for the wedding &#8211; it is also very thorough in helping you plan, so you won’t forget some of the easily overlooked details of the day. Everyone from C-Zone showed up on time, they were welcoming and professional, and they played a major role in making our wedding truly special.</p>\\n<p>About the string quartet &#8211; just wow! In the beginning, we didn&#8217;t really consider live musicians for our ceremony. I&#8217;m so glad we changed our minds because the C-Zone musicians were incredible. They had a large library of songs across multiple genres (not just classical!) to choose from, and we even had the option to request a song that wasn&#8217;t on the list. We picked quite a few non-traditional songs including Another One Bites The Dust, The Game of Thrones theme, Truly Madly Deeply, and Stairway to Heaven, and they nailed all of them. The live music filled our ceremony venue (Worcester Art Museum) beautifully.</p>\\n<p>About the photobooth &#8211; It was a really fun addition to the reception, and we got both digital prints of all the photos as well as a really nice physical book with all the pictures that our guests could sign. C-Zone came with cool props, including several modern ones that we hadn&#8217;t seen in other wedding photo booths. Andrea was a great, engaging attendant who added to the fun. Our guests had fun posing, and it was nice to have a separate activity when people needed a break from the dance floor.</p>\\n<p>About the DJ &#8211; we worked with Corey Mitchell (Mr. Bajan), and he was excellent! Right from the first phone consultation, we could tell that he had a lot of experience DJ’ing weddings. He gave great advice and helped us build our playlist and day-of details. It was clear that he read through all of our specific instructions from the portal and made sure to cover everything with us in our final meeting. And then, he absolutely crushed it at the reception. He mixes songs really well, knows how to read the crowd and keeps everyone engaged and dancing without burning them out, and just absolutely nailed everything from start to finish. We also really liked that he had a tablet set up at his booth which made it easier for guests to submit song requests. Corey had a great emcee voice, executed all of the details we asked for, and kept our dance floor lively and engaging for all guests through the entire evening.<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Savannah & Matt // Wedding // AC Hotel // September 2022</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nWe loved Corey! We wanted entertainment that wasn’t over the top cheesy, but still offered guests great music to dance to.
