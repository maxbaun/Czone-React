Our dance floor was never empty! He knew how to read the room and match the vibe. Even my grandma was on the dance floor for hours. It was a true party. We also booked the uplighting through them. After the mother son dance ended and the party began, the lights instantly started changing colors (had been amber for the dinner and special dance) and everyone in the room gasped and clapped. Impressive through and through. You cannot go wrong with CZone!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Tyler + Philippe // Wedding // Hamilton Hall // January 2023</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe hired Freddy (DJ Backspin) as our DJ for our wedding through C-Zone Entertainment and we couldn&#8217;t be happier with our choice. The C-Zone platform included a planning tool that made it very easy to stay organized and plan. Freddy himself was incredibly professional and truly a master of his craft. My husband and I didn&#8217;t give him a ton of details of what we wanted other than a few genres and artists that aren&#8217;t our favorites and he created such a fun atmosphere with great music that kept people from all generations dancing all night long. He was key in keeping the flow of the wedding together as well and brought lighting that added a cool element to our wedding as well. Do not hesitate to work with C-Zone or DJ Freddy. Having a high quality DJ and entertainment service is so worth it, in our minds it was the key to having a successful fun wedding!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Michelle + Kevin // Wedding // Tupper Manor // November 2022</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Perfect time with DJ Freddy and Harpist</h3>\n<p>We could not be happier with our choice to work with C-Zone and DJ Freddy, as well as a live harpist for our ceremony. Freddy asked us great questions and made suggestions during our consultation, and adapted to the non-traditional vibe we were looking for. He made a great playlist based on our taste! Our guests also loved the live harpist during the ceremony. And it was so great to have Freddy&#8217;s help with setting our officiant up with a microphone.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Riannon & Steve, Barn at Gibbet Hill, 9.21.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Excellent DJ!</h3>\n<p>We hired Freddy for our wedding and couldn&#8217;t have been happier with him! Since the beginning, he was proactive, friendly, and professional, reaching out to us, getting to understand our music preferences, and any other special considerations. We mostly communicated via email but we also talked with him on the phone and visited him in person prior to the wedding. He was very flexible and open, making it easy to reach out to him. During the wedding, he made sure we knew how it was going, asking us any questions and generally helping us relax and enjoy everything. His music and DJing was excellent, keeping our guests dancing and engaged. He ended on a perfect note, getting everyone up and dancing as a final note to the evening. We highly recommend Freddy for weddings or any kind of event that needs DJing.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Christine & Carol, Dane Estate, 4.13.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Freddy,</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have already informed all my colleagues here in the events department of HBS that you are THE BEST DJ I have ever worked with on an event and we will definitely be reaching out again.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for everything.
