We wanted entertainment that wasn’t over the top cheesy, but still offered guests great music to dance to. We had specific song requests that were important to us and not on the portal, but Corey was able to get them for us. We were so pleased to find exactly what we wanted in a DJ with Corey. Thank you!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Jennifer + Jamie // Wedding // Saphire Estate // October 2022</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nMy now wife and I got married in small town in Maine and Corey was recommended to us through our wedding planner. From the pre-planning Corey did all the way through the entire event I could not recommend him more. He knew how to keep the dance floor full, and was very accommodating with guest song requests (as well as to honor our no play list songs). I could not recommend him more and we thank him very much for his role in our special day.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Christina &amp; Richard // Wedding // Breakwater Inn, Kennebunkport, ME // October 2021</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nI hired Corey for my wedding and I can&#8217;t say enough about how great he made our day. He was in constant contact with us leading up to the date. He helped us sort out the playlist, gave suggestions, and was a great emcee, announcing us as husband and wife. Even the venue commented on how easy and professional he was to work with. He worked one on one with them to make sure everything that was needed was there. We didn&#8217;t have to worry about anything. He showed up earlier than promised to set everything up, and gave us and our guests an amazing time. Our friends still talk about it to this day. Whenever I have an event or know someone in need of a DJ, he&#8217;s always my first call.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Chris &amp; Kelly</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nI originally didn&#8217;t want to hire a DJ for my engagement party, as I was trying to cut costs, but my Maid of Honor convinced me to hire Corey at the last minute. BEST DECISION EVER, and worth every penny. My friends even made a point to comment on how good the music selection was. Will be using him again in the future without a doubt.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Krissy</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:.9666666666666667,src:"/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-77eb3.jpg 660w,\n/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-78eca.jpg 880w,\n/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d928a.jpg 1160w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d928a.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-10d9a.jpg",height:414,width:400,srcSet:"/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-738fa.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/e4bd30d554d659237012c9bf5b8245d5-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-4042a.jpg 2x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"8daf2a19-34de-5fd2-9149-f09dcaccde28"}}}});
