In pursuing his passion for great music he left the security of a day job and put all of his savings and resources into purchasing a state-of-the-art digital sound system, taught himself how to DJ, and started knocking on doors. Being a musician for his entire professional career that began in the early 1990&#8217;s, the transition was seamless. Soon the public recognized C-Zone&#8217;s talent and what started as a one man show has flourished into a full production company offering 12 DJs, multiple jazz and classical ensembles and some amazing lighting options. He is incredibly proud to have built this company from the ground up with nothing but hard work, dedication, persistence, passion and of course talent.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>As a DJ/Emcee, C-Zone has performed at countless special events including weddings, corporate functions, private parties, and much more. He currently performs at over 125 parties annually, mostly weddings and high-end corporate affairs. He has held residencies in some of Boston&#8217;s hottest venues including Felt, Umbria, Mantra and Pravda (now Gipsy Bar). And let&#8217;s not forget a few private parties for Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn during the filming of Mystic River. C-Zone&#8217;s personality, professionalism, and ability to keep the dance floor moving make him the ideal choice for your event.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p><br />\nAs a saxophone and woodwind player, C-Zone has performed all over the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean with appearances at The Montreal Jazz Festival, Disney World, Epcot Center, Club Med, Carnival Cruise Lines, and a guest appearance with performers from Cirque de Soleil.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Some highlights of C-Zone&#8217;s career include a 5 year tenure with Rippopotamus, voted &#8220;Best Funk Band&#8221; at the Boston Music Awards in 1996. This 8 piece all original funk/rock band routinely packed clubs such as The Middle East, Mama Kin, and Ryles. In the fall of 1996, one of Rippo&#8217;s songs was selected as the theme for &#8220;Singled Out,&#8221; a popular dating show on MTV. In 1998 Rippo performed at the internationally famous Montreal Jazz Festival, and rang in the New Year in 2000 with a week long stint at Jimmy Buffet&#8217;s Margaritaville in Key West, FL.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>More recently C-Zone has been working as an underground recording artist with some local and national record producers of dance music. One of his saxophone solos has been featured on Plastic City Records which specializes in House music. The same track was featured on a compilation called Sunrise at ES Cavallet in Ibiza in 2009. This is an incredible accomplishment since Ibiza is the number one destination for dance music in the world.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>C-Zone is not your average DJ. As a musician he hears and thinks about music differently and his unique approach has profound results on the dance floor. He will rock your cocktail and/or dinner set on his sax and pack your dance floor with his beats&#8230;</p></div></p>\n',title:"Greg Capozzi",acf:{title:"DJ, Emcee, Sax",video:"",facebook:"https://www.facebook.com/greg.capozzi.7",instagram:"http://instagram.com/czonemusic",testimonials:'<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nC-Zone is the best in the business! From the planning process until the end of the night C-Zone absolutely crushed it! I am the type of person that can complain about anything because I am a perfectionist and I can safely say there was not ONE thing I could complain about from C-Zone. I trusted Greg with making our night one to remember and he delivered on that promise tenfold!!</p>\n<p>I never knew how much went into this process until I spoke with Greg. He took the time to have multiple calls with my wife and I to get a feel for what kind of wedding we were going for. He also has an incredible website where you plan everything about your wedding, from the schedule to the songs so everything goes flawlessly and let me tell you, our wedding went FLAWLESSLY.</p>\n<p>There may be other wedding DJs out there, but I can say with confidence that none compare to Greg from C-Zone. Greg is someone who takes pride in his work which is something that is hard to come by these days.</p>\n<p>My wife and I chose a string trio which C-Zone also offers and it added such a classy element to our wedding. They have a HUGE catalogue of songs you can pick from ranging from traditional, to modern day pop songs. We had them play during our cocktail hour and they also played during our wedding ceremony when we walked in and after we were pronounced husband and wife. I HIGHLY recommend booking strings from C-Zone. Our wedding wouldn&#8217;t have been the same without it.</p>\n<p>There was one moment during our wedding that stood out to me. There was one specific song that I wanted to be introduced as Husband and Wife to, but there was a specific part of the song that I wanted to walk out too. This specific part was over a minute into the song, meaning that there would be a full minute between when the wedding party was introduced and when me and my wife would be introduced. About 5 minutes before this was supposed to take place I met with Greg in the waiting room before we would be introduced. He explained how the introductions were going to go for everyone in the wedding party, then he went over with me and my wife how our part would go. Greg confirmed the song that we were going to walk out to, and I told him the exact part we wanted to walkout to and this was our exact exchange:</p>\n<p>Greg:: &#8220;That&#8217;s a full minute into the song&#8230;.&#8221;<br />\nMe: &#8220;Yes, it has to be this part&#8230;&#8221;<br />\nGreg: **Brief Pause** &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it work..&#8221;</p>\n<p>This moment was just as dramatic as you read it. It was all on the line at this moment..<br />\nNot only did Greg make it work, he absolutely nailed it! It felt like every moment of my life had led up to that exact moment and Greg made absolutely sure that it happened!</p>\n<p>To say Greg went above and beyond for our wedding would be the understatement of the century. Aside from Greg being an incredible DJ, he is really just a truly incredible person with an incredible personality and just one of those people that you know is an all around great person.</p>\n<p>If you are lucky enough to book Greg just know that you are booking with the best and with someone who truly cares about how your night goes. I can&#8217;t recommend C-Zone enough!! 10/10!!!!!</p>\n<p></p><p class="from">Kenny + Krystina // Wedding // Tupper Manor // January 2023</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nTo say booking C-Zone Entertainment was the easiest and best decision in wedding planning would be an incredible understatement! I work for a wedding venue, just outside of Boston, and when I worked with Greg Capozzi and his incredible team back in June of 2017 for a client&#8217;s wedding, I knew when it was my turn to get married, I wanted C-Zone as part of the day.<br />\nGreg, Diane and Gina were so helpful (and FUN) from start to finish. Booking was a breeze, and C-Zone&#8217;s online platform was really easy to use for noting details leading up to our pre-wedding planning meeting. I love how we could note our &#8216;must play, would like to play, and do not play&#8217; preferences. </p>\n<p>We booked Peter as our guitarist for the ceremony, the trio of Peter (guitar), Shane (keys) and Greg (sax) for cocktail hour and Greg as our DJ for the reception. It was honestly the best of both worlds having live music + DJ. Guests were blown away. </p>\n<p>As for the dance floor, well it was PACKED from the second toasts were done until we were chanting &#8216;ONE LAST SONG&#8221; at the end of the night. The transition from different genres was incredible and the rave reviews we have from our older aunts and uncles to our Gen-Z cousins have not stopped pouring in. I keep watching videos from the evening wishing I had the playlist to listen to!! We added uplighting, too, which created such a soft vibe during dinner and party vibe later in the evening. I am so glad we added it. So, make your wedding planning just a little bit easier and stop your entertainment search at C-Zone. It will be your best decision ever!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Sara + Steve // Wedding // Regatta Place // October 2022</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nI cannot say enough good things about Greg and Diane. I am lucky enough to know them as friends, because I was not only a bride, but I am a wedding planner. I have worked with them for 5 years prior to hiring them as the DJ and lighting techs for my wedding &#8211; and it was the best decision I could have made. They went above and beyond to ensure that everyone had the best time. The dance floor was PACKED the entire wedding. I had dozens of people say that Greg was the best dj they had ever experienced. When the venue coordinator fell short on their role of managing the timeline, Diane stepped in to make it happen. Our guests thought she worked for the venue! Their attention to detail and professional knowledge is unparalleled. They are the best and I am so glad I hired them!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Marissa + Rich // Wedding // The Mountainview Grand // November 2022</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Masters of Entertainment in Their Industry!</h3>\n<p>Full warning this is going to be very long and detailed so if you just want a summary of why I Chose Greg and C-Zone Entertainment, just scroll to the bottom. 🙂<br />\nMy now husband and I had a two year engagement so picking our vendors wasn’t as stressful because we felt we had plenty of time to talk to all the “best of the best” and thinking about our final decision. We had originally talked to a very large wedding company that many people use, more specifically the owner of that company. At the end of the convo, I didn’t feel any “connection” but figured this guy was supposed to be the best so let’s do it. During our conversation he referenced his business numerous times and was pretty cocky but I ignored it. Thankfully, before we signed, we ended up getting in touch with Greg from C-Zone who many people referred us to as well. It was a COMPLETE 180 in the conversation. Greg was truly a breath of fresh air, talked about OUR wedding, OUR guests, OUR day. We could feel his passion immediately and not knowing much about music, he explained his process and feeling the crowd instead of going in with a “set playlist” as most DJs do. Again, we didn’t understand much about the technical aspect he was discussing but his excitement was getting us excited, a match made in heaven. We immediately signed with him and throughout the rest of our planning process, we never second guessed that decision.<br />\nFast forward to 6 months before the wedding, Greg remembered our awesome conversation and that excitement came right back. At that point we had booked the jazz trio with him (another amazing decision) and confirmed the uplighting and monogram that he custom made for us with the guys he worked with.<br />\nFast forward to our final meeting, we got to meet him and his lovely wife Diane (couple goals). For the first HOUR we just chatted about the wedding and life and music and it was like we had known him for years. Finally, we got to the nitty gritty details and he was so great. We laughed about the songs we didn’t want him to play, he wrote down in his notes how to pronounce every name in our wedding party correctly and we just got so hyped up for the night. Greg has also worked with a lot of venues over the years so those great connections he has with the coordinators are so key.</p>\n<p>Now for the wedding night! The monogram was set up exactly where we wanted it, the jazz trio set the mood during the cocktail hour and Greg came down to make sure everyone was in order for introductions and to see how we were doing&#8230; oh, and also hyped up our wedding party! He absolutely killed it all night long. Mixed songs, read the crowd, and saw how packed the dance floor was at all times and chose to keep the party going without any slow songs which of course the crowd went nuts over. Throughout the night people came up to us telling us how great he was, people that I know don’t normally dance at weddings were up on their feet, it was wild to see. My husband and I were so sad to have to say goodbye to him but thankfully the following day, several engaged couples at our wedding asked us for his info so we hope to see him in the future!</p>\n<p>In summary, I chose Greg because the guy just has straight up crazy talent, reading his audience, incredible mixes, and the passion is just felt all the way through the process. Greg is such a down to earth guy, he is not like an obnoxious club DJ that talks about himself and his business the whole time, it was so refreshing. Actually, he didn&#8217;t get on the mic once except to make introductions and announcements because he didn’t need to, his music hyped the crowd up, he didn’t need to scream and play pump horns and crap. I can not recommend him enough, I so hope we see him at an event in the future.</p>\n<p></p><p class="from">Lindsay &amp; Marc, Cruiseport, 7.13.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nI work in the hotel industry and see A LOT of weddings in the course of a year. This also means that I see a wide variety of DJ&#8217;s, live music, bands, etc. When it came to planning our own wedding I knew I wanted a quality company that would listen to us, guide us, and most importantly be something my guests wouldn&#8217;t forget. We got all that and then some with Greg at C-Zone. Upon our inquiry, he immediately set up a google hangout call with us and made sure we connected on every level. He was informative, hilarious, and a great person to talk to. To me, that is an extremely important part of the wedding planning process, as I wanted to enjoy communicating with my wedding vendors. He and Diane were responsive, flexible, and accommodating to any questions we had. He was always there to guide us through song choices and tricky things like parent dances. We also booked him for live sax music, a keys player, and uplighting. To which all of these things were our choice. At no point did he try to pressure us into including extras or make our event about anything other than US! We knew we were in good hands with an experienced professional. Throughout the process and on the wedding day, we could not have been more amazed and pleased with EVERYTHING C-Zone provided. Everyone RAVED about the live music during the ceremony and cocktail hour, all of the up lights were in the perfect spot, and the dance floor was rocking all night. The C-Zone quote is &#8220;It&#8217;s not our show, it&#8217;s your event&#8221;, and this is really true. Not once did Greg promote his services over the mic- he solely concentrated on making our music set and dance floor the best it could be, while still being a great MC for intros and necessary announcements. The transitions were perfect and our crowd loved chatting him up when they had requests. By the next day, the C-Zone name was something everyone was passing along. We are so grateful to Greg and his entire team for everything they did for us and for being part of the most amazing day. So moral of the story is- if you&#8217;re looking for a quality, talented, and committed music vendor- you will not find a company better than C-Zone- so just stop looking!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Noelle & Daniel, The Barn at Gibbet Hill, 11.1.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe are so thrilled we had C-Zone entertainment for our wedding and I would 1000% recommend them to any other couples! For our package, we had a string trio for the ceremony, microphones &#038; wireless lapel mics for the ceremony, musicians during cocktail hour, DJ services for the rest of the reception, and uplighting. It was a large package, but Greg and his team executed it all flawlessly!! Our guests raved about our DJ and people were dancing ALL night, which is probably the best indicator of a great DJ! Greg was extremely professional with the announcements during the evening (no cheesy comments!!) and he was on the ball with our timeline to ensure the evening flowed smoothly. During the planning process, we had a couple of phone calls with Greg at different stages and he was always so friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and full of recommendations. We felt like he was truly invested in making sure we had the best party for our wedding, which made us feel extremely confident in him on the wedding day. We could tell that he is a very passionate musician and we had no worries that he’d be able to create the vibe we wanted. Beyond the music, setting up the appropriate number of sound systems and microphones (especially for the ceremony) is so critical and Greg was all over those details for us. We had no issues at all with people not being able to hear, even though the ceremony was outside. The process of preparing for the wedding with Czone was also extremely organized and well-managed between Greg and Diane. I loved that C-Zone uses an online planning portal, which helps make it very straightforward to list out all timeline details and song requests. Greg and Diane were both highly responsive to any questions we had, which is not always the case with wedding vendors!! You will have no regrets if you choose C-Zone for your wedding!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Erica & Nick, Turner Hill, 9.14.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nMy husband and I could not be happier with our decision to book Greg for our wedding. From our initial informational phone call through our final planning meeting, Greg was professional, kind and personable. In addition, he is TRULY an artist who is familiar with many types of music and really knows how to read a room. Our guests stayed on the dance floor all night long and I say this without exaggeration, I lost count of how many people told me we had the best DJ ever. Greg certainly played an integral part in making our wedding the most fun we&#8217;ve ever had. I&#8217;d whole heartedly recommend Greg&#8217;s services for any event.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Laura & Zandy, Hawthorne Hotel, 8.23.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>So organized &#038; truly knows what they are doing!</h3>\n<p>Greg &#038; his team at C-Zone Entertainment are the obvious choice to make your wedding day truly unforgettable! My sister and I both used them for our wedding &#038; every single guest could not stop talking about how wonderful the music was &#038; you could tell because every person was dancing all night long! This is what couple&#8217;s dream for on their wedding day! You want the music to be enjoyable for every type of person at your wedding &#038; Greg just truly understands how to read the crowd. Our wedding day would NOT have been the same without Greg. Book them now &#038; book the live trio for cocktail hour, too! You won&#8217;t regret it and all of your guests will be blown away!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Callie & Mike, Bedford Village Inn, 10.4.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Absolutely perfect, 100%</h3>\n<p>My wedding was amazing because of these guys!!</p>\n<p>First of all, DJ Greg and C-Zone made the planning process so easy and stress-free!! The online planning tool contains everything you need to help you plan the details. The online meetings with Greg were super convenient and so helpful in the planning process, as he took the time and care to ensure that we were getting exactly what we wanted.<br />\nC-Zone truly has so many different options available for all your music needs on your wedding day. They supplied the music during our prelude, had a live jazz band for cocktail hour, and then Greg was our DJ for the reception.</p>\n<p>While planning with Greg, he assured me that he would be able to read the crowd and, based on that, play songs that would keep people on the dance floor! He did exactly that!</p>\n<p>He knew just what songs to play (including all my requests), and we danced the entire night!! People are still raving a month later about how much fun they had at the wedding, and I know that wouldn&#8217;t have been the case if it wasn&#8217;t for Greg!!<br />\n100% would recommend!!!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Jenna & Peter, Castle Manor Inn, 9.28.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Professional, talented and made the reception the huge dance party we envisioned!</h3>\n<p>We had very high expectations for a DJ and C-Zone definitely exceeded them! C-Zone, Greg and Diane were very professional and easy to work with, their online tools were great and they were super communicative throughout the whole process. Most importantly they made our wedding the awesome dance party we were hoping for. It was clear from our first conversation on the phone that Greg was really passionate about his work and that made him stand out from other options, so the decision to move forward was easy. We knew the broad strokes of how we envisioned our reception and Greg helped turn that into a reality. He took a sampling of music that we told him we liked and turned that into a set that our guests from ages 19 to 90 enjoyed and danced too. One of my guests commented that our dance floor should&#8217;ve been even bigger because it was packed all night long. Beyond the reception Greg was the MC for the entire wedding. This is something we hadn&#8217;t realized we needed when first looking for a DJ, but were very happy to have. He managed the music at the ceremony and cocktail hour, all the announcements, speech introductions etc. I have only great things to say about them and would highly recommend C-Zone for your wedding!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Seth & Erica, The Collonade Boston, 5.11.19</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.302734375,src:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg",srcSet:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-2c2fe.jpeg 110w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-a2e2b.jpeg 220w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-d0643.jpeg 440w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-77eb3.jpeg 660w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-78eca.jpeg 880w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-6ece6.jpeg 1320w,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg 2001w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-7c5c4.jpeg"},full:{src:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg",height:307,width:400,srcSet:"/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-10d9a.jpeg 1x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-738fa.jpeg 1.5x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-4042a.jpeg 2x,\n/static/8ae30b2e9f2d40e02a2f169d19dde986-a819b5e6541865c7b6051b2ad544fcf6-935ac.jpeg 3x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"8bf0629c-1ea8-5945-b721-7260a9ed3018"}}}});
