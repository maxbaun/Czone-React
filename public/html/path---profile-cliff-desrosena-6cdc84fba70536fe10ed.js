The planning process was easy and stress free. We had a couple of calls with DJ Cliff about our vision for the day and he was an absolute dream to work with! He was friendly and professional. He seamlessly mixed songs and kept the party going all night. We got so many compliments on the DJ after the wedding. Truly was the best night of our life and I think a HUGE part of that was thanks to DJ Cliff and C-Zone entertainment<br />\n</p><p class="from">Casey + TJ // Wedding // Butternut Farm Golf Club // April 2023</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5052754982415006,src:"/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-77eb3.jpg 660w,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-78eca.jpg 880w,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-38d87.jpg 1284w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-38d87.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-10d9a.jpg",height:266,width:400,srcSet:"/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-738fa.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-4042a.jpg 2x,\n/static/189af77bb347665c92510807f651b154-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-935ac.jpg 3x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"a40173e1-9745-53df-b894-83108e83162e"}}}});
