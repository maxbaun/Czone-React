Highly recommend C-Zone!</h3>\n<p>We can&#8217;t recommend C-Zone Entertainment enough for your wedding! We booked our DJ, pianist for the cocktail hour, and uplighting through them. Their prices are very reasonable and the quality of the service was exceptional. They set us up with DJ Max, who was so great! He was super flexible and very responsive when we had any questions or needed anything. Our wedding night was amazing and the dance floor was so fun! The wedding planner tool C-Zone uses is super user friendly and allows you to have some say in what songs you want played and what songs you don&#8217;t want played, but also gives your DJ some freedom to play off the crowd. We had a NYE wedding and it was a 6 hour reception going until 12:30 so I was nervous people might get tired, leaving the dance floor empty, but I was amazed at how many people (of all ages) were on the dance floor up until the very end. And that was due to DJ Max! I can&#8217;t recommend them enough.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Meagan &amp; John, Granite Links, 12.31.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Need this team for your wedding!!</h3>\n<p>From start to finish, I can not say enough good things about C-Zone. Music was one of the most important things to my husband and I for our wedding. We did our research and C-Zone was well recommended to us. We wanted the perfect mix of old school and new school to get the party started. To say Max Baun delivered is an understatement. He worked with us through the whole process to learn and deliver our vision. He was professional, timely, and brought the best vibes to our wedding. He was one of the vendors I never needed to worry about delivering, and that&#8217;s huge on your wedding day. Still have people saying he was the best wedding DJ they&#8217;ve ever heard. HIGHLY RECOMMEND C-Zone + Max Baun for your wedding or any other event!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Laura &amp; Jerry, Gurney’s Newport Resort, 10.26.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Max is the bomb!!!</h3>\n<p>We knew when we witnessed Max spin his beats at my sister’s wedding that we had to have Max at our wedding. He does all the things you&#8217;d want any great DJ to do &#8211; read the room, play the hits, and straight up just kill it and get the party going. Not only that, but he was so chill ahead of time, taking time to understand what our vibe was and how to execute it. He was proactive with communication and really well organized. We were in great hands and then on the night of the wedding, Max CRUSHED IT. My husband, myself, and my Chardonnay didn&#8217;t leave the dance floor virtually the entire night. Weeks after, my friends are still asking how they can get their hands on the playlist that night. Don&#8217;t look any further, book Max, party all night.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Hilary &amp; Josh, Olio, 12.7.19</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5827160493827162,src:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-4115e.jpg 641w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-4115e.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-10d9a.jpg",height:253,width:400,srcSet:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-738fa.jpg 1.5x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"d4b59e8b-1c77-5398-997d-c6be2557708b"}}}});
