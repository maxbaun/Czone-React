From our initial phone interview with Max to the day-of our wedding, our conversations with him felt so natural. Not only did Max provide excellent insight into our music decisions for everything from the ceremony to the last song of our wedding, but he also was an amazing time-keeper and emcee throughout the night. Max worked flawlessly with our venue team and photographer to keep our formalities on pace. Not to mention that he put together the PERFECT playlist that kept our guests dancing all night!! We did not want to leave the dance floor at the end of our reception, and that is all thanks to a fantastic DJ who listened to every one of our thoughts and requests. Outside of an awesome DJ, C-Zone’s communication, payment process and planning tools were easy to navigate and accessible. We cannot recommend them enough! Thank you to Max and c-zone for helping to make our day everything we dreamed!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Mary Kate and Peter, The Barn at Gibbet Hill, 8.23.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe had our wedding on 6/8/25 at Willowdale Estate! We used C-Zone Entertainment for our music and reception photo-booth! We decided on a string duo (violin and cello) for our ceremony and cocktail hour music which was a wonderful touch to our estate venue. They played beautifully! It was such a smooth process to be able to book all music and entertainment options through C-Zone rather than working with a bunch of different vendors. For our reception, we worked with DJ Max Baun! He did an AMAZING job! From the planning process to the day of the wedding, Max was there to help us the whole way through and was an excellent communicator. Our dancefloor was PACKED the entire night. I still have guests now 3 months later telling me that our wedding was the best they had ever been to and they had so much fun on our dancefloor! He did an excellent job of blending wedding classic and modern songs so that everyone enjoyed themselves. I am beyond thankful that Max made our day so special! He deserves way more than 5 stars! Do yourself a favor and stop scrolling to find a wedding DJ. Book Max at C-Zone Entertainment!!! I cannot recommend him enough, thank you for everything C-Zone Entertainment and DJ Max!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Jenna and Anderson, Willowdale Estate, 6.8.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe hired C-Zone Entertainment to provide DJ services for our wedding and it was the best decision we could&#8217;ve made! Gina was our first point of contact and she was so responsive to all of our questions during the booking process and afterwards! They ended up matching us with DJ Max Baun who was incredible!!! We had a few meetings with him during the planning process to discuss what we wanted for music on the wedding day. He was very responsive and made sure he fully understood what we were looking for. On the wedding day, Max absolutely delivered!! The dance floor was packed all night and we had so many people comment on how amazing he was! Max didn&#8217;t try to steal the show and he focused on playing awesome music to keep the crowd dancing! C-zone was also reasonably priced in terms of DJ services and uplighting which we also booked for the wedding day. We highly recommend DJ Max and C-zone for people looking to party and dance all night long!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Brianna and Alec, Beauport Hotel, 4.12.25</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5827160493827162,src:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-4115e.jpg 641w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-4115e.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-10d9a.jpg",height:253,width:400,srcSet:"/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/8a867a996074e3ecbfaf8a06128220fc-65e70bb7a40c5d099f1d79d2a201e0c1-738fa.jpg 1.5x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"d4b59e8b-1c77-5398-997d-c6be2557708b"}}}});
