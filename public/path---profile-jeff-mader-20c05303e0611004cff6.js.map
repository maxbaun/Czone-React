Everyone that we worked with was extremely professional and easy to work with. Jeff was our DJ and completely knocked it out of the park. He was so detail oriented with every single task- he helped us pick out lighting that ended up saving us thousands of dollars, helped with all of our AV needs and was one of the best wedding DJs I&#8217;ve seen. Jeff was also invaluable when it came to anything music related. We wanted to have a live element as well as a DJ, so we booked a saxophone player that blew everyone away when they played together. He was able to mix/cut a song for my husband and I when we requested to shorten our wedding song. He cut the song down and worked with the sax to make a seamless song that we will remember forever.<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Kristyn & Yigitcan, Boston Public Library, 8.17.19</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nC-Zone was wonderful to work with. I would also say affordable for the quality of service they offer. We decided on C-Zone because we had attended a wedding where one of the DJs they work with was DJing. They are quick to respond and work with you on figuring out what you need. Our DJ Jeff (DJ Shyne) was fantastic. He spent time going through what we were planning efficiently and it was clear from our conversations that he had the experience to take a relatively small amount of information and develop a plan for the whole picture.

From the initial inquiry through the wedding day, C-Zone is responsive, friendly and organized with competitive pricing and great customer service. We were lucky enough to have DJ Shyne (aka Jeff) as our wedding DJ and he was the perfect choice. He truly understands the ebbs and flows of an event and how to set the right tone with the right music. He was attuned to the different age ranges of our guests and super organized and professional, while also exuding a warm, positive vibe. Shyne, with the help of C-Zone&#8217;s online portal, kept us on track through the planning process and he checked in with us at key moments during the event as well. The result was a beautiful evening and fun dance party.
