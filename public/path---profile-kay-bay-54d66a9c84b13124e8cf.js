We booked C-Zone ~1year before our wedding, and from the start C-Zone was quick to respond and sent us all the important info for planning. Our DJ, Kate, was absolutely fantastic to work with, she was very responsive to our emails/questions and was very accommodating. She did a fantastic job during the reception, everyone was on the dance floor having a blast practically the whole night!

We immediately received a response from C-Zone that was reassuring that they could do just that. We hired DJ Kay Bay, who made our day perfect and seamless. She was so kind and truly caring . She wanted nothing but for us to have a perfect day, she emailed us with any clarification questions and set up consultation meetings from beginning to end. DJ Kay Bay provided perfect music for the prelude, ceremony, cocktail hour, party music!, and music to conclude our day. We gave her few suggestions on what we liked and she took it from there! Thank you so much DJ Kay Bay!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Dawn & Logan // Wedding // The Greenery // May 2022</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p>Kate did an outstanding job!!

Our DJ bailed on our wedding on the Monday morning before our Thursday wedding. I searched and found DJ Kay Bay who immediately scheduled a meeting with us and went over our song list and bridal party. Not only was she extremely accommodating and extremely fair in her pricing, she was amazing during our reception! I am confident that she was a million times more prepared and caring than our original DJ ever would have been!
