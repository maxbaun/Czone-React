He was professional, easygoing, and totally understood the vibe we wanted for the night. During the reception, he read the room perfectly — the energy never dipped, and he had everyone on the dance floor all night long! So many of our guests commented on how incredible he was and how fun the music felt throughout the entire evening. The transitions, song choices, and pacing were spot on — it truly made our reception unforgettable. I can’t recommend DJ Cliff and C-Zone Entertainment enough. If you want a DJ who keeps the party going and creates the best atmosphere, he’s the one!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Stephanie and Michael, Tupper Manor, 10.17.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe used C-Zone and DJ Cliff for our wedding reception! They were listed on our venue&#8217;s preferred client list and we are so grateful to have found them! Cliff was so great throughout the planning process &#8211; he fully understood the vibe we were going for and executed!! We also had a meeting a few weeks before our day where he played the different specific versions of the songs we wanted to use for our first and parent dances, which was so helpful and put us at ease to ensure a smooth night! Highly recommend DJ Cliff and the team at C-Zone!!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Lauren and Jarred, Granite Links, 9.27.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nSimply put, DJ Cliff Desrosena and C-Zone Entertainment were amazing!! We hired C-Zone for our wedding on June 22, 2025, and we couldn’t be happier with our decision! From our very first interactions, Gina and DJ Cliff were professional, responsive, and genuinely enthusiastic about making our day special. In the planning phase, Cliff took the time to understand our music preferences, timeline, and overall vibe. He made helpful suggestions, listened to our plans and even accommodated our special requests, including music for the Hora. </p>\n<p>On the day of the wedding, Cliff was punctual, well-prepared, and brought incredible energy to the event. The ceremony music was timed perfectly, the cocktail hour had the perfect background ambiance, and once the reception started—WOW! The dance floor was packed the entire night. Our guests are still raving about how much fun they had. What really stood out to us was his ability to read the crowd and keep the energy flowing. The transitions between songs were seamless, and he kept everyone—from our younger nieces and nephews to our older relatives—dancing and smiling. We are so grateful to Cliff for helping create such unforgettable memories. Highly, highly recommend to any couple looking for an amazing wedding DJ!</p>\n<p></p><p class="from">Azhar and Samantha, The Barn at Gibbet Hill, 6.22.25</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBP/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAdVVuMKH/8QAGxABAQABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIiAxESEzH/2gAIAQEAAQUCNXPsQ9OBSztMOH//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAcEAACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRECESUaH/2gAIAQEABj8Cnz0okajd+Yd7XQxH/8QAGxABAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFRcZH/2gAIAQEAAT8hWkmk1uX/ACOYKB6Qo80W8hK4LPgz/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCDz//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8QP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8QP//EAB0QAQACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFBMVFxgZH/2gAIAQEAAT8Q5syuCNbzFYMJl1g5hTgoLE64CGxNPtPqAisQBWmjwRFHrP/Z",aspectRatio:1.5052754982415006,src:"/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-77eb3.jpg 660w,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-78eca.jpg 880w,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-38d87.jpg 1284w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-38d87.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-10d9a.jpg",height:266,width:400,srcSet:"/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-738fa.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-4042a.jpg 2x,\n/static/87a69f167d7902b025185ad1958d8498-7ea100c283443ce24364cd9be240a96a-935ac.jpg 3x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"a40173e1-9745-53df-b894-83108e83162e"}}}});
