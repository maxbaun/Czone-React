Max was everything we had hoped our DJ would be. He was extremely professional, he played great music and had great transitions, and he wonderfully wove our must-have songs into sets with songs that kept our guests engaged and dancing! We had several guests compliment Max to us, saying how great of a DJ we had. He brought the perfect vibe for our event, never overly inserting himself, but providing exactly what we asked for. Max made sure every audio and sequencing detail of the ceremony and reception were exactly what we were envisioning, and his expertise was obvious both during the pre-wedding process and on our big day itself.

Max Baun was the DJ for our wedding and truly brought the night we had imagined to life. He played the perfect mix of songs to get the crowd dancing the night away. Max was incredibly helpful throughout the process, having multiple calls with us to get a sense of our favorite songs, the timeline for the evening, and any special requests! He was able to seamlessly weave multiple Greek dance songs into the set which everyone loved! Max was also the perfect MC for the evening! Our dance was packed the entire night and we received so many compliments from our guests about how amazing the music was throughout the night.

If you want your guests up on the dance floor all night long, Max is your guy! He has done several family member&#8217;s weddings prior to our own, so we knew we wanted to have him for ours. When we were picking a date we reached out to C-Zone to make sure we could secure Max for our big day. He did not disappoint. During planning we were impressed that he remembered both siblings wedding he had done several years prior. Max truly cares and strives to deliver a stellar event, thinking of every little detail and delivering an amazing performance. He knows exactly what works well at so many venues. Shoutout to Greg and Gina at C-Zone as well! The booking, payment options and planning portal were smooth and easy to use.

We cannot recommend him and the C-Zone team enough. C-Zone was very responsive and easy to work with throughout the planning process. They have a user friendly portal to include certain requests for the evening which was very nice. Their strings team did a wonderful job for our ceremony and cocktail hour (with a massive list of songs to work with, including being able to learn new ones). At our reception, our dance floor was packed the entire evening. DJ Max Baun kept people dancing all night with an awesome setlist that truly catered to us and our guest list, and some of the coolest (and smoothest) transitions I&#8217;d ever heard between songs. One of the most talented DJ&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever heard &#8211; many of our guests (including several who have musical backgrounds) complimented him at the end of the night. If you need a DJ for our wedding, this is who you want.<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Jacob + Elizabeth // Wedding // The Liberty Hotel // November 2022</p></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p></p>\\n<h3>DJ Max was the best! Highly recommend C-Zone!</h3>\\n<p>We can&#8217;t recommend C-Zone Entertainment enough for your wedding! We booked our DJ, pianist for the cocktail hour, and uplighting through them. Their prices are very reasonable and the quality of the service was exceptional. They set us up with DJ Max, who was so great! He was super flexible and very responsive when we had any questions or needed anything. Our wedding night was amazing and the dance floor was so fun! The wedding planner tool C-Zone uses is super user friendly and allows you to have some say in what songs you want played and what songs you don&#8217;t want played, but also gives your DJ some freedom to play off the crowd. We had a NYE wedding and it was a 6 hour reception going until 12:30 so I was nervous people might get tired, leaving the dance floor empty, but I was amazed at how many people (of all ages) were on the dance floor up until the very end. And that was due to DJ Max!

Music was one of the most important things to my husband and I for our wedding. We did our research and C-Zone was well recommended to us. We wanted the perfect mix of old school and new school to get the party started. To say Max Baun delivered is an understatement. He worked with us through the whole process to learn and deliver our vision. He was professional, timely, and brought the best vibes to our wedding. He was one of the vendors I never needed to worry about delivering, and that&#8217;s huge on your wedding day. Still have people saying he was the best wedding DJ they&#8217;ve ever heard.

He does all the things you&#8217;d want any great DJ to do &#8211; read the room, play the hits, and straight up just kill it and get the party going. Not only that, but he was so chill ahead of time, taking time to understand what our vibe was and how to execute it. He was proactive with communication and really well organized. We were in great hands and then on the night of the wedding, Max CRUSHED IT. My husband, myself, and my Chardonnay didn&#8217;t leave the dance floor virtually the entire night. Weeks after, my friends are still asking how they can get their hands on the playlist that night.
