Hiring him was the single best decision we made for our wedding.  He is outstanding, a true artist in his craft. It’s so clear that he’s not only dedicated to his profession but also deeply loves what he does. We gave DJ Shyne what we thought was an impossible challenge: blend pop hits, Spanish tunes, emo throwbacks, Disney jams, booty-shaking hip hop, and a long list of theme songs from our favorite TV shows and movies (everything from The White Lotus to Saw). On top of that, we added a handful of random, deeply personal songs you’d never expect at a wedding. What happened? Not only did he execute this perfectly but he became the catalyst for a wedding that felt curated exactly to us &#8211;  spinning a history of us both as individuals and our journey together woven into a seamless soundtrack.  </p>\\n<p>His mixing was unique, unexpected, and so much fun. As the bride, there was no place I wanted to be except on that dance floor. Our guests went wild. Compliments poured in all night and days after. The amount of texts we received akin to “BROOO your DJ?! 🔥🔥🔥” we started to lose count.  But it wasn’t just about the music. From the very first Zoom, DJ Shyne radiated charisma and professionalism. He carried that positive energy into every planning meeting and right through the reception- he even gave our speakers personal pep talks before their toasts! No confusion, no awkward guessing, just pure joy and inclusion.<br />\\nHe quickly became the vendor we looked forward to meeting with most. We ended each Zoom call feeling assured, uplifted, and excited about the possibilities.  Out of everyone we worked with, he was the best.  It does not get better than DJ Shyne.
