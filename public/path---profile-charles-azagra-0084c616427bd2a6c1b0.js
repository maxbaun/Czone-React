At age 11 he began studying piano which trained his ear to hear melodies and harmonies. As a young adult, he developed his DJ skills while working at a recording studio. Being surrounded by amazing musicians as they conducted their studio sessions fed more into his understanding of musical styles.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Possessing a keen ear for how music and songs are structured, coupled with his vast knowledge of different genres across the decades, makes Charles a well versed DJ capable of reading any crowd in any situation. His mixes range from all decades from the 50s to today, ensuring that everyone on the dance floor will hear feel good music that is familiar to them.</p></div></p>\n<p><div class="content-block  text-center"><p>Aside from his busy schedule performing at wedding, corporate and private events, Charles has performed as A DJ throughout the Northeast at nightclubs such as Whisky Saigon, West End Johnnies, Storyville, Wonder Bar, Lawn on D, Down Ultra Lounge, Alibi, Murphy&#8217;s (Salem)  Rebel Lounge (Providence), and Whiskey Republic (Providence) just to name a few.</p></div></p>\n',title:"Charles Azagra",acf:{title:"DJ, Emcee",video:"https://youtu.be/U3T8vrpYStQ?si=eJTiF0dqNoJ2HPFi",facebook:"https://www.facebook.com/charles.azagra",instagram:"https://www.instagram.com/czonecharles/",testimonials:'<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe had gone into wedding planning with one specific DJ in mind, who ended up being booked on the date we had chosen. We were feeling super stressed out as the dance floor was our BIGGEST priority for our wedding. We were given a recommendation for C-Zone so we decided to reach out. Gina was incredibly responsive, easy to work with, and a great coordinator. We were introduced to DJ Charles early on and decided to move forward with him. We truly cannot express how grateful we are to have had him be a part of our big day. We had a PACKED dance floor from start to finish. There was never a lull or a good time to go to the bathroom, if you did, you were sprinting back for the next jam. DJ Charles delivered the exact vibe we had hoped for. Our dance floor was absolutely the most memorable part of the night. He played all the right music, mixing songs, following where the crowd was, etc. We genuinely could not have imagined a better DJ.  DJ Charles was the perfect MC, never making it about him or taking away from the music or us. Introductions were great, he was incredibly easy to talk to and to work with, the list goes on.  If you&#8217;re looking for the perfect DJ, we cannot recommend DJ Charles and C-Zone enough!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Jamie and Paul, The River Club, 11.14.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nWe couldn’t have asked for a better DJ than DJ Charles for our wedding! From the very beginning, he was warm, professional, and incredibly easy to work with. He took the time to understand our music tastes, the vibe we wanted, and all the little details that mattered to us. On the big day, Charles absolutely delivered. The ceremony music was perfectly timed, the cocktail hour had a great atmosphere, and once the reception started, the dance floor was full all night. He knew exactly how to read the crowd and transition between songs seamlessly. Our guests are still talking about how great the music was! Beyond the music, Charles was an exceptional emcee—enthusiastic but never over the top, and always keeping everything running smoothly. If you want a DJ who is talented, reliable, and a joy to work with, you can’t go wrong with DJ Charles. Highly recommended!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Meg and Peter, The Mansion on Turner Hill, 10.24.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nC-Zone Entertainment surpassed our expectations and was the highlight of our wedding! They were a one stop shop for our DJ, Lights, Pianist during cocktail hour, Photo Booth, and even a saxophonist/violinist to compliment the DJ!  The communication with the C-Zone team (Gina and DJ Charles/Chizzy) was easy and effortless from start to finish. And on the day of, the talent and quality each musician provided blew away our guests!  DJ Chizzy had the dance floor packed all night and did a fantastic job playing our requests while mixing in his style based on the dance floor. The saxophonist (Greg) and electric violinist (Lynne) complimenting DJ Chizzy was out of this world great. It felt like a concert and a show wrapped in one. They got on the dance floor with us and interacted with our guests. I can’t tell you how many compliments we received about these musicians. I cannot recommend C-Zone enough, my only job as the groom was to find the musicians/lights for our wedding night and C-Zone made me look great! If you’re reading this I promise C-Zone, especially DJ Chizzy, Greg, and Lynne will deliver! Thanks again for an unforgettable night!<br />\n</p><p class="from">Blake and Allison, Boston Harbor Hotel, 9.12.25</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.1843434343434343,src:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-d23fc.png",srcSet:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-1b2f3.png 110w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-d29cd.png 220w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-d23fc.png 440w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-54e74.png 660w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-e4770.png 880w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-956df.png 1320w,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-3a4a8.png 1876w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-3a4a8.png"},full:{src:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-37095.png",height:338,width:400,srcSet:"/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-37095.png 1x,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-99bcd.png 1.5x,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-603c4.png 2x,\n/static/1ff0fe93374ede1f01eeca165d7a46fa-41410ede81ab43ee9254bf5f24a4d612-acdf4.png 3x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"c392ef9a-6ba0-548f-8338-c1bb5d70b02a"}}}});
