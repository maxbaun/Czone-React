With the stresses of wedding planning, Jeff&#8217;s kind and upbeat personality during every DJ planning session was very much appreciated, and helped assure that we were in good hands. He is very knowledgeable about music and the art of crafting the perfect playlist &#8211; we knew he was a great fit after our first meeting. We also appreciated how responsive he was, and how pleasant the C-Zone coordinating team was to work with. Everyone has been telling us how much fun the dance floor was at our wedding, so I’d say that’s a huge success! If you’re looking for a fantastic DJ, we highly recommend Jeff.

The C-Zone website and event planning forms were easy to work with and fill out. DJ Shyne was extremely professional and on his A game from our first phone call, even before we had hired him. We had intro calls with a few DJs, and DJ Shyne blew us away and impressed us right off the bat. He was extremely organized, and brought up questions and ideas that we hadn’t even considered. He made us feel so comfortable with the flow of the day, but also gave us confidence that if something were to go off script, he would know exactly how to manage and adjust. </p>\\n<p>In terms of the music, everything was perfect. The music during the ceremony and cocktail hour was exactly what we wanted and matched the vibe of what we previously requested and discussed. For the reception, we were able to suggest songs that we didn’t want played as well as songs that had to be played. DJ Shyne knocked it out of the park. He provided us with the correct vibe and energy we wanted and kept people dancing the whole night. </p>\\n<p>One of the key things we noticed is that once the dance floor opened, the music didn’t stop. Songs were mixed and flowed from one song to the next, with DJ Shyne maintaining energy all night. There were no awkward pauses or stoppages of music ever. This kept people dancing and on the floor the entire night. We had so many rave reviews from our guests about how great the DJ and music was, and we feel the exact same.
