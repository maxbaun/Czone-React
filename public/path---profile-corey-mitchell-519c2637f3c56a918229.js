We&#8217;ve had friends and family express some frustrations after their own weddings with the DJs they had hired, but every preliminary phone call with Corey put our minds at ease and made us feel like we were in good hands. Corey was always warm, gracious, and open to all of our requests for how we wanted music integrated into our wedding. He delivered in a huge way. He used our playlists in a way that kept the dance party alive, using his own expertise to blend with our (sometimes very niche) music selections. Corey was supremely professional, and we would hire him again in a heartbeat.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Carlee and Bobby, Olio, 8.2.25</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p><br />\nMany guests said &#8220;best wedding dance floor we&#8217;ve been on&#8221;. C-Zone was collaborative, easy to work with and DJ Corey Mitchell was 10/10.

The whole process was super smooth and Gina was very easy to communicate with over email. DJ Corey was great and kept the dance floor packed the whole night! The photo booth was run so well and the quality of the pictures was excellent. Definitely don&#8217;t hesitate to book with C-Zone for your wedding (or any other event!)<br />\n</p><p class="from">Samantha and Alec, Connemara House Farm, 9.13.25</p></div>\n'},image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{thumbnail:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:.9666666666666667,src:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d0643.jpg",srcSet:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-2c2fe.jpg 110w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-a2e2b.jpg 220w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d0643.jpg 440w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-77eb3.jpg 660w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-78eca.jpg 880w,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d928a.jpg 1160w",sizes:"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px",originalImg:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-d928a.jpg"},full:{src:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-10d9a.jpg",height:414,width:400,srcSet:"/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-10d9a.jpg 1x,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-738fa.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/58d45de0c866f4d5760e4e6caffbda8d-c538e0d152ea4b928470f17dcd6b13cf-4042a.jpg 2x"}}}},yoast:{title:"",canonical:"",metaDescription:"",linkdex:"",metakeywords:"",noIndex:"",noFollow:"",meta_robots_adv:"",metaKeywords:"",redirect:"",ogTitle:"",ogDescription:"",ogImage:"",twitterTitle:"",twitterDescription:"",twitterImage:""}},site:{id:"Site",siteMeta:{title:"C-Zone Entertainment",subtitle:"Premiere DJs & Musicians | Servicing Greater Boston & New England | 617.320.0723"}}},pathContext:{id:"8daf2a19-34de-5fd2-9149-f09dcaccde28"}}}});
