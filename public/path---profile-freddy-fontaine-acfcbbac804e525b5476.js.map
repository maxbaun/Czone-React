Once we put in a request, Gina from C-Zone promptly responded to our request to better understand our vision and needs. She then referred us to Freddy, who we were able to meet via call. Freddy was very helpful with helping us understand the A/V needs for our event, as well as guiding us to determine the vibe we wanted for our music throughout the night. He had great ideas but was never pushy, encouraging us to really think about our priorities. It was very easy to communicate via email and calls, while using C-Zone&#8217;s planning tool to figure out logistics. On the wedding day, Freddy did a fantastic job crafting a playlist that kept people dancing, also checking with us throughout the night to make sure we were having a good time. We had several guests tell us that they loved the song selections, especially unique remixes of classic songs. Freddy also went above and beyond with introducing our toast speeches, coordinating extra lights that changed color with the music, and more.
