Since 2012, he has been DJing various events in the New England area such as weddings, private events, and fundraisers. While attending college, he continued to grow his talents by DJing more events at various local Boston bars (West End Johnnies, The Harp and Ned Devine’s). In 2013 Cliff received an internship with DJ Maverik from Boston&#8217;s popular radio station, Jam’n 94.5. Cliff was able to work alongside Maverik at various events and gained more knowledge of on-air radio daily agendas.</p>\\n<p>Cliff’s experience as a DJ/MC is noticed immediately.

We gave him a few ideas of songs we’d love to hear remixed or mashed up with another song on the dance floor, and he took those ideas and ran with them to make creative mixes that we were thrilled to hear while dancing. Many of our family and friends commented on how much fun the music was and appreciated the flow of the music throughout the night, and we could not agree more.

He moved seamlessly from song to song and made sure that our guests felt like they were a part of the day. We also used the photo booth from C-Zone. Our guests had a blast holding up signs and posing for the camera in front of their rose gold sequin backdrop. On top of all of this, C-Zone made us a personalized guest book with everyone&#8217;s photos from that night. I urge you to look into using C-Zone for your wedding!
