Freddy asked us great questions and made suggestions during our consultation, and adapted to the non-traditional vibe we were looking for. He made a great playlist based on our taste! Our guests also loved the live harpist during the ceremony. And it was so great to have Freddy&#8217;s help with setting our officiant up with a microphone.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Riannon & Steve, Barn at Gibbet Hill, 9.21.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<h3>Excellent DJ!</h3>\n<p>We hired Freddy for our wedding and couldn&#8217;t have been happier with him! Since the beginning, he was proactive, friendly, and professional, reaching out to us, getting to understand our music preferences, and any other special considerations. We mostly communicated via email but we also talked with him on the phone and visited him in person prior to the wedding. He was very flexible and open, making it easy to reach out to him. During the wedding, he made sure we knew how it was going, asking us any questions and generally helping us relax and enjoy everything. His music and DJing was excellent, keeping our guests dancing and engaged. He ended on a perfect note, getting everyone up and dancing as a final note to the evening. We highly recommend Freddy for weddings or any kind of event that needs DJing.<br />\n</p><p class="from">Christine & Carol, Dane Estate, 4.13.19</p></div>\n<div class="content-block content-block-testimonial "><p></p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Freddy,</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have already informed all my colleagues here in the events department of HBS that you are THE BEST DJ I have ever worked with on an event and we will definitely be reaching out again.</p>\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for everything.
