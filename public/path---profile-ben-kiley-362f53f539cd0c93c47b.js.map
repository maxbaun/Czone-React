From the moment we reached out with our initial inquiry to the day of the wedding, Gina at C-Zone was on top of everything and incredibly responsive to our emails, making the logistical part of the planning as easy as possible.  For the actual music, we were so fortunate to get to work with Ben (DJ B-Kay). We were looking for a DJ to mainly play music from the 90s to present day and Ben was perfect for the job. Not only did he keep the dance floor packed the entire night for the younger crowd but he also effortlessly mixed in songs that all ages could enjoy, resulting in our guests repeatedly telling us he was the best wedding DJ they&#8217;d ever seen. Songs transitioned expertly with creative switches and perfect blending in between, but we were most impressed with Ben&#8217;s feel for the dance floor and how he never let a song linger for too long and always seemed to sense when to let a song ride out in its entirety. </p>\\n<p>In short, we could not have been happier with the music and would highly recommend DJ Ben to anyone looking for a DJ. Apart from Ben&#8217;s DJ skill itself, he is also a true professional at what he does on all levels. Through a series of phone calls leading up to the wedding, Ben answered all our questions and was incredibly knowledgeable in terms of how best to set up the sound systems for our outdoor ceremony, outdoor cocktail hour, and indoor reception. Every sound system and microphone worked perfectly without a single hitch. During the day, we changed our plans slightly multiple times and Ben took each change in stride, easily maneuvering around our new requests and making sure everything went smoothly no matter what we threw at him. 10/10 we would recommend C-Zone and DJ Ben!<br />\\n</p><p class=\\\"from\\\">Tom and Sunnie, 9.23.23, Camp Mataponi</p></div><br />\\n<div class=\\\"content-block content-block-testimonial \\\"><p><br />\\nWe were absolutely stumped when it came to hiring a DJ for our wedding! How do you really know who will do a good job? We feel SO lucky that we found Ben Kiley. One friend told me afterwards that in spite of her heels she never left the dance floor because &#8220;all the songs he played were bangers!&#8221; He scheduled several calls with us leading up to the wedding, helping us step by step with various decisions and was always kind and positive. He suggested a playlist for dinner when we were exhausted by wedding decision making. </p>\\n<p>On the day of the wedding, he played songs that our group absolutely loved (with excellent transitions) and the dance floor was a total highlight of the wedding. We also had several non-English songs we wanted to be played at the wedding, and Ben was extremely enthusiastic about learning about them and choosing when and how many of the songs to play. Stop looking and hire Ben for your wedding!!
